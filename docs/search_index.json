In this book we will take a unpretentious glance at the most fundamental algorithms which stood the test of time and which still form the basis for the state-of-the-art solutions of the modern-era AI, which is principally (big) data-driven. We will learn how to use the R language (R Development Core Team 2020) for implementing various stages of data processing and modelling activities. For a more in-depth treatment of R, refer to this book’s Appendices and, for instance, (Wickham &amp; Grolemund 2017, Peng 2019, Venables et al. 2020). We will provide solid underpinnings for further studies related to statistical learning, machine learning data science, data analytics and artificial intelligence, including (Bishop 2006, Hastie et al. 2017, James et al. 2017). We will appreciate the vital role of mathematics as a commonly accepted language for formalising data-intense problems and communicating their solutions. The book is aimed at readers who are yet to be fluent with university-level linear algebra, calculus and probability theory, such as 1st year undergrads or those who have forgotten all the maths they have learned and need a gentle, non-invasive, yet rigorous enough, introduction to the topic. For a nice, machine learning-focused introduction to mathematics alone, see, e.g., (Deisenroth et al. 2020). About Me I’m currently a Senior Lecturer in Applied AI at Deakin University in Melbourne, Australia and an Associate Professor in Data Science at Warsaw University of Technology, Poland, where I teach various courses related to R and Python programming, algorithms, data science and machine learning. This book was also influenced by my teaching experience at Data Science Retreat in Berlin, Germany. I’m an author of several R and Python packages, including stringi, which is among the top 20 most often downloaded R extensions. I’m an author of more than 70 publications, my research interests include machine learning and optimisation algorithms, data aggregation and clustering, statistical modelling and scientific computing. Acknowledgements This book has been prepared with pandoc, Markdown and GitBook. R code chunks have been processed with knitr. A little help of bookdown, good ol’ Makefiles and shell scripts did the trick.

["machine-learning.html", "1.1 Machine Learning", " 1.1 Machine Learning 1.1.1 What is Machine Learning? An algorithm is a well-defined sequence of instructions that, for a given sequence of input arguments, yields some desired output. In other words, it is a specific recipe for a function. Developing algorithms is a tedious task. In machine learning, we build and study computer algorithms that make predictions or decisions but which are not manually programmed. Learning needs some material based upon which new knowledge is to be acquired. In other words, we need data. 1.1.2 Main Types of Machine Learning Problems Machine Learning Problems include, but are not limited to: Supervised learning – for every input point (e.g., a photo) there is an associated desired output (e.g., whether it depicts a crosswalk or how many cars can be seen on it) Unsupervised learning – inputs are unlabelled, the aim is to discover the underlying structure in the data (e.g., automatically group customers w.r.t. common behavioural patterns) Semi-supervised learning – some inputs are labelled, the others are not (definitely a cheaper scenario) Reinforcement learning – learn to act based on a feedback given after the actual decision was made (e.g., learn to play The Witcher 7 by testing different hypotheses what to do to survive as long as possible) "],
["supervised-learning.html", "1.2 Supervised Learning", " 1.2 Supervised Learning 1.2.1 Formalism Let \\(\\mathbf{X}=\\{\\mathfrak{X}_1,\\dots,\\mathfrak{X}_n\\}\\) be an input sample (“a database”) that consists of \\(n\\) objects. Most often we assume that each object \\(\\mathfrak{X}_i\\) is represented using \\(p\\) numbers for some \\(p\\). We denote this fact as \\(\\mathfrak{X}_i\\in \\mathbb{R}^p\\) (it is a \\(p\\)-dimensional real vector or a sequence of \\(p\\) numbers or a point in a \\(p\\)-dimensional real space or an element of a real \\(p\\)-space etc.). Of course, this setting is abstract in the sense that there might be different realities hidden behind these symbols. This is what maths is for – creating abstractions or models of complex entities/phenomena so that they can be much more easily manipulated or understood. This is very powerful – let’s spend a moment contemplating how many real-world situations fit into this framework. If we have “complex” objects on input, we can try representing them as feature vectors (e.g., come up with numeric attributes that best describe them in a task at hand). How would you represent a patient in a clinic? How would you represent a car in an insurance company’s database? How would you represent a student in an university? This also includes image/video data, e.g., a 1920×1080 pixel image can be “unwound” to a “flat” vector of length 2,073,600. (*) There are some algorithms such as Multidimensional Scaling, Locally Linear Embedding, IsoMap etc. that can do that automagically. In cases such as this we say that we deal with structured (tabular) data – \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) can be written as an (\\(n\\times p\\))-matrix: \\[ \\mathbf{X}= \\left[ \\begin{array}{cccc} x_{1,1} &amp; x_{1,2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; x_{1,p} \\\\ x_{2,1} &amp; x_{2,2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; x_{2,p} \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ x_{n,1} &amp; x_{n,2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; x_{n,p} \\\\ \\end{array} \\right] \\] Mathematically, we denote this as \\(\\mathbf{X}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times d}\\). Structured data == think: Excel/Calc spreadsheets, SQL tables etc. Example: The famous Fisher’s Iris flower dataset, see ?iris in R and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set. X &lt;- iris[1:6, 1:4] # first 6 rows and 4 columns X # or: print(X) ## Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width ## 1 5.1 3.5 1.4 0.2 ## 2 4.9 3.0 1.4 0.2 ## 3 4.7 3.2 1.3 0.2 ## 4 4.6 3.1 1.5 0.2 ## 5 5.0 3.6 1.4 0.2 ## 6 5.4 3.9 1.7 0.4 dim(X) # gives n and p ## [1] 6 4 dim(iris) # for the full dataset ## [1] 150 5 \\(x_{i,j}\\in\\mathbb{R}\\) represents the \\(j\\)-th feature of the \\(i\\)-th observation, \\(j=1,\\dots,p\\), \\(i=1,\\dots,n\\). For instance: X[3, 2] # 3rd row, 2nd column ## [1] 3.2 The third observation (data point, row in \\(\\mathbf{X}\\)) consists of items \\((x_{3,1}, \\dots, x_{3,p})\\) that can be extracted by calling: X[3,] ## Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width ## 3 4.7 3.2 1.3 0.2 as.numeric(X[3,]) # drops names ## [1] 4.7 3.2 1.3 0.2 length(X[3,]) ## [1] 4 Moreover, the second feature/variable/column is comprised of \\((x_{1,2}, x_{2,2}, \\dots, x_{n,2})\\): X[,2] ## [1] 3.5 3.0 3.2 3.1 3.6 3.9 length(X[,2]) ## [1] 6 We will sometimes use the following notation to emphasise that the \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) matrix consists of \\(n\\) rows or \\(p\\) columns: \\[ \\mathbf{X}=\\left[ \\begin{array}{c} \\mathbf{x}_{1,\\cdot} \\\\ \\mathbf{x}_{2,\\cdot} \\\\ \\vdots\\\\ \\mathbf{x}_{n,\\cdot} \\\\ \\end{array} \\right] = \\left[ \\begin{array}{cccc} \\mathbf{x}_{\\cdot,1} &amp; \\mathbf{x}_{\\cdot,2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\mathbf{x}_{\\cdot,p} \\\\ \\end{array} \\right]. \\] Here, \\(\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot}\\) is a row vector of length \\(p\\), i.e., a \\((1\\times p)\\)-matrix: \\[ \\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot} = \\left[ \\begin{array}{cccc} x_{i,1} &amp; x_{i,2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; x_{i,p} \\\\ \\end{array} \\right]. \\] Moreover, \\(\\mathbf{x}_{\\cdot,j}\\) is a column vector of length \\(n\\), i.e., an \\((n\\times 1)\\)-matrix: \\[ \\mathbf{x}_{\\cdot,j} = \\left[ \\begin{array}{cccc} x_{1,j} &amp; x_{2,j} &amp; \\cdots &amp; x_{n,j} \\\\ \\end{array} \\right]^T=\\left[ \\begin{array}{c} {x}_{1,j} \\\\ {x}_{2,j} \\\\ \\vdots\\\\ {x}_{n,j} \\\\ \\end{array} \\right], \\] where \\(\\cdot^T\\) denotes the transpose of a given matrix – think of this as a kind of rotation; it allows us to introduce a set of “vertically stacked” objects using a single inline formula. 1.2.2 Desired Outputs In supervised learning, apart from the inputs we are also given the corresponding reference/desired outputs. The aim of supervised learning is to try to create an “algorithm” that, given an input point, generates an output that is as close as possible to the desired one. The given data sample will be used to “train” this “model”. Usually the reference outputs are encoded as individual numbers (scalars) or textual labels. In other words, with each input \\(\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot}\\) we associate the desired output \\(y_i\\): # in iris, iris[, 5] gives the Ys iris[sample(nrow(iris), 3), ] # three random rows ## Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species ## 14 4.3 3.0 1.1 0.1 setosa ## 50 5.0 3.3 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 118 7.7 3.8 6.7 2.2 virginica Hence, our dataset is \\([\\mathbf{X}\\ \\mathbf{y}]\\) – each object is represented as a row vector \\([\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot}\\ y_i]\\), \\(i=1,\\dots,n\\): \\[ [\\mathbf{X}\\ \\mathbf{y}]= \\left[ \\begin{array}{ccccc} x_{1,1} &amp; x_{1,2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; x_{1,p} &amp; y_1\\\\ x_{2,1} &amp; x_{2,2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; x_{2,p} &amp; y_2\\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\vdots\\\\ x_{n,1} &amp; x_{n,2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; x_{n,p} &amp; y_n\\\\ \\end{array} \\right], \\] where: \\[ \\mathbf{y} = \\left[ \\begin{array}{cccc} y_{1} &amp; y_{2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; y_{n} \\\\ \\end{array} \\right]^T=\\left[ \\begin{array}{c} {y}_{1} \\\\ {y}_{2} \\\\ \\vdots\\\\ {y}_{n} \\\\ \\end{array} \\right]. \\] 1.2.3 Types of Supervised Learning Problems Depending on the type of the elements in \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) (the domain of \\(\\mathbf{y}\\)), supervised learning problems are usually classified as: regression – each \\(y_i\\) is a real number e.g., \\(y_i=\\) future market stock price with \\(\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot}=\\) prices from \\(p\\) previous days classification – each \\(y_i\\) is a discrete label e.g., \\(y_i=\\) healthy (0) or ill (1) with \\(\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot}=\\) a patient’s health record ordinal regression (a.k.a. ordinal classification) – each \\(y_i\\) is a rank e.g., \\(y_i=\\) rating of a product on the scale 1–5 with \\(\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot}=\\) ratings of \\(p\\) most similar products Example Problems – Discussion: Which of the following are instances of classification problems? Which of them are regression tasks? What kind of data should you gather in order to tackle them? Detect email spam Predict a market stock price Predict the likeability of a new ad Assess credit risk Detect tumour tissues in medical images Predict time-to-recovery of cancer patients Recognise smiling faces on photographs Detect unattended luggage in airport security camera footage Turn on emergency braking to avoid a collision with pedestrians A single dataset can become an instance of many different ML problems.

["simple-regression.html", "1.3 Simple Regression", " 1.3 Simple Regression 1.3.1 Introduction Simple regression is the easiest setting to start with – let’s assume \\(p=1\\), i.e., all inputs are 1-dimensional. Denote \\(x_i=x_{i,1}\\). We will use it to build many intuitions, for example, it’ll be easy to illustrate all the concepts graphically. library(&quot;ISLR&quot;) # Credit dataset plot(Credit$Balance, Credit$Rating, las=1) # scatter plot In what follows we will be modelling the Credit Rating (\\(Y\\)) as a function of the average Credit Card Balance (\\(X\\)) in USD for customers with positive Balance only. X &lt;- as.matrix(as.numeric(Credit$Balance[Credit$Balance&gt;0])) Y &lt;- as.matrix(as.numeric(Credit$Rating[Credit$Balance&gt;0])) plot(X, Y, las=1) Our aim is to construct a function \\(f\\) that models Rating as a function of Balance, \\(f(X)=Y\\). We are equipped with \\(n=310\\) reference (observed) Ratings \\(\\mathbf{y}=[y_1\\ \\cdots\\ y_n]^T\\) for particular Balances \\(\\mathbf{x}=[x_1\\ \\cdots\\ x_n]^T\\). Note the following naming conventions: Variable types: \\(X\\) – independent/explanatory/predictor variable \\(Y\\) – dependent/response/predicted variable Also note that: \\(Y\\) – idealisation (any possible Rating) \\(\\mathbf{y}=[y_1\\ \\cdots\\ y_n]^T\\) – values actually observed The model will not be ideal, but it might be usable: We will be able to predict the rating of any new client. What should be the rating of a client with Balance of $1500? What should be the rating of a client with Balance of $2500? We will be able to describe (understand) this reality using a single mathematical formula so as to infer that there is an association between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) Think of “data compression” and laws of physics, e.g., \\(E=mc^2\\) or \\({\\displaystyle i\\hbar {\\frac {d}{dt}}\\vert \\Psi (t)\\rangle ={\\hat {H}}\\vert \\Psi (t)\\rangle }\\) (*) Mathematically, we will assume that there is some “true” function that models the data (true relationship between \\(Y\\) and \\(X\\)), but the observed outputs are subject to additive error: \\[Y=f(X)+\\varepsilon.\\] \\(\\varepsilon\\) is a random term, classically we assume that errors are independent of each other, have expected value of \\(0\\) (there is no systematic error = unbiased) and that they follow a normal distribution. (*) We denote this as \\(\\varepsilon\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma)\\) (read: random variable \\(\\varepsilon\\) follows a normal distribution with expected value of \\(0\\) and standard deviation of \\(\\sigma\\) for some \\(\\sigma\\ge 0\\)). \\(\\sigma\\) controls the amount of noise (and hence, uncertainty). Here is the plot of the probability distribution function (PDFs, densities) of \\(\\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma)\\) for different \\(\\sigma\\)s: 1.3.2 Search Space and Objective There are many different functions that can be fitted into the observed \\((\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y})\\) Thus, we need a model selection criterion. Usually, we will be interested in a model that minimises appropriately aggregated residuals \\(f(x_i)-y_i\\), i.e., predicted outputs minus observed outputs, often denoted with \\(\\hat{y}_i-y_i\\). Top choice: sum of squared residuals: \\[ \\begin{array}{rl} \\mathrm{SSR}(f|\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y}) &amp; = \\left( f(x_1)-y_1 \\right)^2 + \\dots + \\left( f(x_n)-y_n \\right)^2 \\\\ &amp; = \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left( f(x_i)-y_i \\right)^2 \\end{array} \\] Read “\\(\\sum_{i=1}^n z_i\\)” as “the sum of \\(z_i\\) for \\(i\\) from \\(1\\) to \\(n\\)”; this is just a shorthand for \\(z_1+z_2+\\dots+z_n\\). The notation \\(\\mathrm{SSR}(f|\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y})\\) means that it is the error measure corresponding to the model \\((f)\\) given our data. We could’ve denoted it with \\(\\mathrm{SSR}_{\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y}}(f)\\) or even \\(\\mathrm{SSR}(f)\\) to emphasise that \\(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y}\\) are just fixed values and we are not interested in changing them at all (they are “global variables”). We enjoy SSR because (amongst others): larger errors are penalised much more than smaller ones (this can be considered a drawback as well) (**) statistically speaking, this has a clear underlying interpretation (assuming errors are normally distributed, finding a model minimising the SSR is equivalent to maximum likelihood estimation) the models minimising the SSR can often be found easily (corresponding optimisation tasks have an analytic solution – studied already by Gauss in the late 18th century) (**) Other choices: regularised SSR, e.g., lasso or ridge regression (in the case of multiple input variables) sum or median of absolute values (robust regression) Fitting a model to data can be written as an optimisation problem: \\[ \\min_{f\\in\\mathcal{F}} \\mathrm{SSR}(f|\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y}), \\] i.e., find \\(f\\) minimising the SSR (seek “best” \\(f\\)) amongst the set of admissible models \\(\\mathcal{F}\\). Example \\(\\mathcal{F}\\)s: \\(\\mathcal{F}=\\{\\text{All possible functions of one variable}\\}\\) – if there are no repeated \\(x_i\\)’s, this corresponds to data interpolation; note that there are many functions that give SSR of \\(0\\). \\(\\mathcal{F}=\\{ x\\mapsto x^2, x\\mapsto \\cos(x), x\\mapsto \\exp(2x+7)-9 \\}\\) – obviously an ad-hoc choice but you can easily choose the best amongst the 3 by computing 3 sums of squares. \\(\\mathcal{F}=\\{ x\\mapsto ax+b\\}\\) – the space of linear functions of one variable etc. (e.g., \\(x\\mapsto x^2\\) is read “\\(x\\) maps to \\(x^2\\)” and is an elegant way to define an inline function \\(f\\) such that \\(f(x)=x^2\\)) "],
["simple-linear-regression-1.html", "1.4 Simple Linear Regression", " 1.4 Simple Linear Regression 1.4.1 Introduction If the family of admissible models \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) consists only of all linear functions of one variable, we deal with a simple linear regression. Our problem becomes: \\[ \\min_{a,b\\in\\mathbb{R}} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left( ax_i+b-y_i \\right)^2 \\] In other words, we seek best fitting line in terms of the squared residuals. This is the method of least squares. This is particularly nice, because our search space is just \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\) – easy to handle both analytically and numerically. Which of these is the least squares solution? 1.4.2 Solution in R Let’s fit the linear model minimising the SSR in R. For convenience, let us store both \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) in a data frame: XY &lt;- data.frame(X=X, Y=Y) head(XY, 3) ## X Y ## 1 333 283 ## 2 903 483 ## 3 580 514 The lm() function (linear models) has a convenient formula-based interface. In R, the expression “Y~X” denotes a formula, which we read as: variable Y is a function of X. Note that the dependent variable is on the left side of the formula. f &lt;- lm(Y~X, data=XY) Note that here X and Y refer to column names in the XY data frame. print(f) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = Y ~ X, data = XY) ## ## Coefficients: ## (Intercept) X ## 226.4711 0.2661 Hence, the fitted model is: \\[ Y = f(X) = 0.2661459X+226.4711446 \\qquad (+ \\varepsilon) \\] Coefficient \\(a\\) (slope): f$coefficient[2] ## X ## 0.2661459 Coefficient \\(b\\) (intercept): f$coefficient[1] ## (Intercept) ## 226.4711 SSR: sum(f$residuals^2) ## [1] 2132108 sum((f$coefficient[2]*X+f$coefficient[1]-Y)^2) # equivalent ## [1] 2132108 To make a prediction: Xnew &lt;- data.frame(X=c(1500, 2000, 2500)) f$coefficient[2]*Xnew$X + f$coefficient[1] ## [1] 625.6900 758.7630 891.8359 or: predict(f, Xnew) ## 1 2 3 ## 625.6900 758.7630 891.8359 However: predict(f, data.frame(X=c(5000))) ## 1 ## 1557.201 This is more than the highest possible rating – we have been extrapolating way beyond the observable data range. Plotting: plot(X, Y, col=&quot;#000000aa&quot;, las=1) abline(f, col=2, lwd=3) Note that our \\(Y=aX+b\\) model is interpretable and well-behaving: (not all machine learning models will have this feature, think: deep neural networks, which we rather conceive as black boxes) we know that by increasing \\(X\\) by a small amount, \\(Y\\) will also increase (positive correlation), the model is continuous – small change in \\(X\\) doesn’t yield any drastic change in \\(Y\\), we know what will happen if we increase or decrease \\(X\\) by, say, \\(100\\), the function is invertible – if we want Rating of \\(500\\), we can compute the associated preferred Balance that should yield it (provided that the model is valid). 1.4.3 Derivation of the Solution (**) (You can safely skip this part if you are yet to know how to search for a minimum of a function of many variables and what are partial derivatives) Denote with: \\[ E(a,b)=\\mathrm{SSR}(x\\mapsto ax+b|\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y}) =\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left( ax_i+b - y_i \\right) ^2. \\] We seek the minimum of \\(E\\) w.r.t. both \\(a,b\\). Theorem. If \\(E\\) has a (local) minimum at \\((a^*,b^*)\\), then its partial derivatives vanish therein, i.e., \\(\\partial E/\\partial a(a^*, b^*) = 0\\) and \\(\\partial E/\\partial b(a^*, b^*)=0\\). We have: \\[ E(a,b) = \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left( ax_i+b - y_i \\right) ^2. \\] We need to compute the partial derivatives \\(\\partial E/\\partial a\\) (derivative of \\(E\\) w.r.t. variable \\(a\\) – all other terms treated as constants) and \\(\\partial E/\\partial b\\) (w.r.t. \\(b\\)). Useful rules – derivatives w.r.t. \\(a\\) (denote \\(f&#39;(a)=(f(a))&#39;\\)): \\((f(a)+g(a))&#39;=f&#39;(a)+g&#39;(a)\\) (derivative of sum is sum of derivatives) \\((f(a) g(a))&#39; = f&#39;(a)g(a) + f(a)g&#39;(a)\\) (derivative of product) \\((f(g(a)))&#39; = f&#39;(g(a)) g&#39;(a)\\) (chain rule) \\((c)&#39; = 0\\) for any constant \\(c\\) (expression not involving \\(a\\)) \\((a^p)&#39; = pa^{p-1}\\) for any \\(p\\) in particular: \\((c a^2+d)&#39;=2ca\\), \\((ca)&#39;=c\\), \\(((ca+d)^2)&#39;=2(ca+d)c\\) (application of the above rules) We seek \\(a,b\\) such that \\(\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial a}(a,b) = 0\\) and \\(\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial b}(a,b)=0\\). \\[ \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{rl} \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial a}(a,b)=&amp;2\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left( ax_i+b - y_i \\right) x_i = 0 \\\\ \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial b}(a,b)=&amp;2\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left( ax_i+b - y_i \\right) = 0\\\\ \\end{array} \\right. \\] This is a system of 2 linear equations. Easy. Rearranging like back in the school days: \\[ \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{rl} a \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i x_i + b \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i = &amp; \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i y_i \\\\ a \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i+ b n = &amp; \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i \\\\ \\end{array} \\right. \\] It is left as an exercise to show that the solution is: \\[ \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{rl} a^* = &amp; \\dfrac{ n \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i y_i - \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i }{ n \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i x_i - \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i }\\\\ b^* = &amp; \\dfrac{1}{n}\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i - a^* \\dfrac{1}{n} \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i \\\\ \\end{array} \\right. \\] (we should additionally perform the second derivative test to assure that this is the minimum of \\(E\\) – which is exactly the case though) Sanity check: n &lt;- length(X) a &lt;- (n*sum(X*Y)-sum(X)*sum(Y))/(n*sum(X*X)-sum(X)^2) b &lt;- mean(Y)-a*mean(X) c(a, b) # the same as f$coefficients ## [1] 0.2661459 226.4711446 (**) In the next chapter, we will introduce the notion of Pearson’s linear coefficient, \\(r\\) (see cor() in R). It might be shown that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) can also be rewritten as: (a &lt;- cor(X,Y)*sd(Y)/sd(X)) ## [,1] ## [1,] 0.2661459 (b &lt;- mean(Y)-a*mean(X)) ## [,1] ## [1,] 226.4711 "],

We studied linear models with a single independent variable based on the least squares (SSR) fit. In the next part we will extend this setting to the case of many variables, i.e., \\(p&gt;1\\), called multiple regression. 1.5.2 Further Reading Recommended further reading: (James et al. 2017: Chapters 1, 2 and 3) Other: (Hastie et al. 2017: Chapter 1, Sections 3.2 and 3.3) "],

Interpretability in ML has always been an important issue, think the EU GDPR, amongst others. The quality of fit can be assessed by performing some descriptive statistical analysis of the residuals, \\(\\hat{y}_i-y_i\\). Interestingly, the mean of residuals (this can be shown analytically) in the least squared fit is always equal to \\(0\\): \\[ \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (\\hat{y}_i-y_i)=0. \\] Therefore, we need a different metric.

For practical purposes, we’d rather model Rating as a function of the other variables. For simple linear regression models, we’d choose either Income or Balance. How about multiple regression? The best model: has high predictive power, is simple. These are often mutually exclusive. Which variables should be included in the optimal model? Again, the definition of the “best” object needs a fitness function. For fitting a single model to data, we use the SSR. We need a metric that takes the number of dependent variables into account. It turns out that the adjusted \\(R^2\\), despite its interpretability, is not suitable for this task. Instead, here we’ll be using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). For a model \\(f\\) with \\(p\\) independent variables: \\[ \\mathrm{AIC}(f) = 2(p+1)+n\\log(\\mathrm{SSR}(f)/n) \\] Our task is to find the combination of independent variables that minimises the AIC. For \\(p\\) variables, the number of possible combinations is \\(2^p\\) (grows exponentially with \\(p\\)). For large \\(p\\), an extensive search is impractical. Therefore, to find the variable combination minimising the AIC, we often rely on one of the two following greedy heuristics: forward selection: start with an empty model find an independent variable whose addition to the current model would yield the highest decrease in the AIC and add it to the model go to step 2 until AIC decreases backward elimination: start with the full model find an independent variable whose removal from the current model would decrease the AIC the most and eliminate it from the model go to step 2 until AIC decreases (*) There are of course many other methods, e.g., lasso regression whose side effect is variable selection.

For example: \\[ Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_1^2 + \\beta_3 X_1^3 + \\beta_4 X_2. \\] Solution: pre-process inputs by setting \\(X_1&#39; := X_1\\), \\(X_2&#39; := X_1^2\\), \\(X_3&#39; := X_1^3\\), \\(X_4&#39; := X_2\\) and fit a linear model: \\[ Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1&#39; + \\beta_2 X_2&#39; + \\beta_3 X_3&#39; + \\beta_4 X_4&#39;. \\] This trick works for every model of the form \\(Y=\\sum_{i=1}^k \\sum_{j=1}^p \\varphi_{i,j}(X_j)\\) for any \\(k\\) and any univariate functions \\(\\varphi_{i,j}\\). Also, with a little creativity (and maths), we might be able to transform a few other models to a linear one, e.g., \\[ Y = b e^{aX} \\qquad \\to \\qquad \\log Y = \\log b + aX \\qquad\\to\\qquad Y&#39;=aX+b&#39; \\] This is an example of a model’s linearisation. For example, here’s a series of simple polynomial regression models of the form Rating~poly(Balance): f1_1 &lt;- lm(Y~X1) f1_3 &lt;- lm(Y~X1+I(X1^2)+I(X1^3)) # also: Y~poly(X1, 3) f1_14 &lt;- lm(Y~poly(X1, 14)) plot(X1, Y, las=1, col=&quot;#000000aa&quot;) x &lt;- seq(min(X1), max(X1), length.out=101) lines(x, predict(f1_1, data.frame(X1=x)), col=&quot;red&quot;, lwd=3) lines(x, predict(f1_3, data.frame(X1=x)), col=&quot;blue&quot;, lwd=3) lines(x, predict(f1_14, data.frame(X1=x)), col=&quot;darkgreen&quot;, lwd=3) 2.3.4 Predictive vs. Descriptive Power The above high-degree polynomial model (f1_14) is a clear example of an overfit. Clearly (based on our expert knowledge), the Rating shouldn’t decrease as Balance increases. In other words, f1_14 gives a better fit to data actually observed, but fails to produce good results for the points that are yet to come. We say that it generalises poorly to unseen data. Assume our true model is of the form: true_model &lt;- function(x) 3*x^3+5 And we generate the following random sample from this model (with \\(Y\\) subject to error): n &lt;- 25 X &lt;- runif(n, min=0, max=1) Y &lt;- true_model(X)+rnorm(n, sd=0.1) plot(X, Y, las=1) x &lt;- seq(0, 1, length.out=101) lines(x, true_model(x), col=2, lwd=3, lty=2) Let’s fit polynomials of different degrees: plot(X, Y, las=1) lines(x, true_model(x), col=2, lwd=3, lty=2) dmax &lt;- 15 # maximal polynomial degree MSE_train &lt;- numeric(dmax) MSE_test &lt;- numeric(dmax) for (d in 1:dmax) { # for every polynomial degree f &lt;- lm(Y~poly(X, d)) # fit a d-degree polynomial y &lt;- predict(f, data.frame(X=x)) lines(x, y, col=d) # MSE on given random X,Y: MSE_train[d] &lt;- mean(f$residuals^2) # MSE on many more points: MSE_test[d] &lt;- mean((y-true_model(x))^2) } Compare the mean squared error (MSE) for the observed vs. future data points: matplot(1:dmax, cbind(MSE_train, MSE_test), type=&#39;b&#39;, las=1, ylim=c(1e-3, 1e3), log=&quot;y&quot;, pch=1:2, xlab=&#39;Model complexity (degree of polynomial)&#39;, ylab=&quot;MSE&quot;) legend(&quot;topleft&quot;, legend=c(&quot;MSE train&quot;, &quot;MSE test&quot;), lty=1:2, col=1:2, pch=1:2) Note the logarithmic scale on the \\(y\\) axis. This is a very typical behaviour! A model’s fit to observed data improves as the model’s complexity increases. A model’s generalisation to unseen data initially improves, but then becomes worse. In the above example, the sweet spot is at a polynomial of degree 3, which is exactly our true underlying model. Hence, most often we should be interested in the accuracy of the predictions made in the case of unobserved data. If we have a data set of a considerable size, we can divide it (randomly) into two parts: training sample (say, 60% or 80%) – used to fit a model test sample (the remaining 40% or 20%) – used to assess its quality (e.g., using MSE) More on this issue in the chapter on Classification. (*) We shall see that sometimes a train-test-validate split will be necessary, e.g., 60-20-20%. "],
["outro-1.html", "2.4 Outro", " 2.4 Outro 2.4.1 Remarks Multiple regression is simple, fast to apply and interpretable. Linear models go beyond fitting of straight lines and other hyperplanes! A complex model may overfit and hence generalise poorly to unobserved inputs. Note that the SSR criterion makes the models sensitive to outliers. Remember: good models \\[=\\] better understanding of the modelled reality \\(+\\) better predictions \\[=\\] more revenue, your boss’ happiness, your startup’s growth etc. 2.4.2 Other Methods for Regression Other example approaches to regression: ridge regression, lasso regression, least absolute deviations (LAD) regression, multiadaptive regression splines (MARS), K-nearest neighbour (K-NN) regression, see FNN::knn.reg() in R, regression trees, support-vector regression (SVR), neural networks (also deep) for regression. 2.4.3 Derivation of the Solution (**) We would like to find an analytical solution to the problem of minimising of the sum of squared residuals: \\[ \\min_{\\beta_0, \\beta_1,\\dots, \\beta_p\\in\\mathbb{R}} E(\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\dots, \\beta_p)= \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left( \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{i,1}+\\dots+\\beta_p x_{i,p} - y_{i} \\right)^2 \\] This requires computing the \\(p+1\\) partial derivatives \\({\\partial E}/{\\partial \\beta_j}\\) for \\(j=0,\\dots,p\\). The partial derivatives are very similar to each other; \\(\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial \\beta_0}\\) is given by: \\[ \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial \\beta_0}(\\beta_0,\\beta_1,\\dots,\\beta_p)= 2 \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left( \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{i,1}+\\dots+\\beta_p x_{i,p} - y_{i} \\right) \\] and \\(\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial \\beta_j}\\) for \\(j&gt;0\\) is equal to: \\[ \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial \\beta_j}(\\beta_0,\\beta_1,\\dots,\\beta_p)= 2 \\sum_{i=1}^n x_{i,j} \\left( \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{i,1}+\\dots+\\beta_p x_{i,p} - y_{i} \\right) \\] Then all we need to do is to solve the system of linear equations: \\[ \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{rcl} \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial \\beta_0}(\\beta_0,\\beta_1,\\dots,\\beta_p)&amp;=&amp;0 \\\\ \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial \\beta_1}(\\beta_0,\\beta_1,\\dots,\\beta_p)&amp;=&amp;0 \\\\ \\vdots\\\\ \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial \\beta_p}(\\beta_0,\\beta_1,\\dots,\\beta_p)&amp;=&amp;0 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right. \\] The above system of \\(p+1\\) linear equations, which we are supposed to solve for \\(\\beta_0,\\beta_1,\\dots,\\beta_p\\): \\[ \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{rcl} 2 \\sum_{i=1}^n \\phantom{x_{i,0}}\\left( \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{i,1}+\\dots+\\beta_p x_{i,p} - y_{i} \\right)&amp;=&amp;0 \\\\ 2 \\sum_{i=1}^n x_{i,1} \\left( \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{i,1}+\\dots+\\beta_p x_{i,p} - y_{i} \\right)&amp;=&amp;0 \\\\ \\vdots\\\\ 2 \\sum_{i=1}^n x_{i,p} \\left( \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{i,1}+\\dots+\\beta_p x_{i,p} - y_{i} \\right)&amp;=&amp;0 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right. \\] can be rewritten as: \\[ \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{rcl} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\phantom{x_{i,0}}\\left( \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{i,1}+\\dots+\\beta_p x_{i,p}\\right)&amp;=&amp; \\sum_{i=1}^n \\phantom{x_{i,0}} y_i \\\\ \\sum_{i=1}^n x_{i,1} \\left( \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{i,1}+\\dots+\\beta_p x_{i,p}\\right)&amp;=&amp;\\sum_{i=1}^n x_{i,1} y_i \\\\ \\vdots\\\\ \\sum_{i=1}^n x_{i,p} \\left( \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{i,1}+\\dots+\\beta_p x_{i,p}\\right)&amp;=&amp;\\sum_{i=1}^n x_{i,p} y_i \\\\ \\end{array} \\right. \\] and further as: \\[ \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{rcl} \\beta_0\\ n\\phantom{\\sum_{i=1}^n x} + \\beta_1\\sum_{i=1}^n \\phantom{x_{i,0}} x_{i,1}+\\dots+\\beta_p \\sum_{i=1}^n \\phantom{x_{i,0}} x_{i,p} &amp;=&amp;\\sum_{i=1}^n\\phantom{x_{i,0}} y_i \\\\ \\beta_0 \\sum_{i=1}^n x_{i,1} + \\beta_1\\sum_{i=1}^n x_{i,1} x_{i,1}+\\dots+\\beta_p \\sum_{i=1}^n x_{i,1} x_{i,p} &amp;=&amp;\\sum_{i=1}^n x_{i,1} y_i \\\\ \\vdots\\\\ \\beta_0 \\sum_{i=1}^n x_{i,p} + \\beta_1\\sum_{i=1}^n x_{i,p} x_{i,1}+\\dots+\\beta_p \\sum_{i=1}^n x_{i,p} x_{i,p} &amp;=&amp;\\sum_{i=1}^n x_{i,p} y_i \\\\ \\end{array} \\right. \\] Note that the terms involving \\(x_{i,j}\\) and \\(y_i\\) (the sums) are all constant – these are some fixed real numbers. We have learned how to solve such problems in high school. Try deriving the analytical solution and implementing it for \\(p=2\\). Recall that in the previous chapter we solved the special case of \\(p=1\\). 2.4.4 Solution in Matrix Form (***) Assume that \\(\\mathbf{X}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times p}\\) (a matrix with inputs), \\(\\mathbf{y}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times 1}\\) (a column vector of reference outputs) and \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{(p+1)\\times 1}\\) (a column vector of parameters). Firstly, note that a linear model of the form: \\[ f_{\\boldsymbol\\beta}(\\mathbf{x})=\\beta_0+\\beta_1 x_1+\\dots+\\beta_p x_p \\] can be rewritten as: \\[ f_{\\boldsymbol\\beta}(\\mathbf{x})=\\beta_0 1+\\beta_1 x_1+\\dots+\\beta_p x_p =\\mathbf{\\dot{x}}\\boldsymbol\\beta, \\] where \\(\\mathbf{\\dot{x}}=[1\\ x_1\\ x_2\\ \\cdots\\ x_p]\\). Similarly, if we assume that \\(\\mathbf{\\dot{X}}=[\\boldsymbol{1}\\ \\mathbf{X}]\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times (p+1)}\\) is the input matrix with a prepended column of \\(1\\)s, i.e., \\(\\boldsymbol{1}=[1\\ 1\\ \\cdots\\ 1]^T\\) and \\(\\dot{x}_{i,0}=1\\) (for brevity of notation the columns added will have index \\(0\\)), \\(\\dot{x}_{i,j}=x_{i,j}\\) for all \\(j\\ge 1\\) and all \\(i\\), then: \\[ \\mathbf{\\hat{y}} = \\mathbf{\\dot{X}} \\boldsymbol\\beta \\] gives the vector of predicted outputs for every input point. This way, the sum of squared residuals \\[ E(\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\dots, \\beta_p)= \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left( \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{i,1}+\\dots+\\beta_p x_{i,p} - y_{i} \\right)^2 \\] can be rewritten as: \\[ E(\\boldsymbol\\beta)=\\| \\mathbf{\\dot{X}} \\boldsymbol\\beta - \\mathbf{y} \\|^2, \\] where as usual \\(\\|\\cdot\\|^2\\) denotes the squared Euclidean norm. Recall that this can be re-expressed as: \\[ E(\\boldsymbol\\beta)= (\\mathbf{\\dot{X}} \\boldsymbol\\beta - \\mathbf{y})^T (\\mathbf{\\dot{X}} \\boldsymbol\\beta - \\mathbf{y}). \\] In order to find the minimum of \\(E\\) w.r.t. \\(\\boldsymbol\\beta\\), we need to find the parameters that make the partial derivatives vanish, i.e.: \\[ \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{rcl} \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial \\beta_0}(\\boldsymbol\\beta)&amp;=&amp;0 \\\\ \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial \\beta_1}(\\boldsymbol\\beta)&amp;=&amp;0 \\\\ \\vdots\\\\ \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial \\beta_p}(\\boldsymbol\\beta)&amp;=&amp;0 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right. \\] (***) Interestingly, the above can also be expressed in matrix form, using the special notation: \\[ \\nabla E(\\boldsymbol\\beta) = \\boldsymbol{0} \\] Here, \\(\\nabla E\\) (nabla symbol = differential operator) denotes the function gradient, i.e., the vector of all partial derivatives. This is nothing more than syntactic sugar for this quite commonly applied operator. Anyway, the system of linear equations we have derived above: \\[ \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{rcl} \\beta_0\\ n\\phantom{\\sum_{i=1}^n x} + \\beta_1\\sum_{i=1}^n \\phantom{x_{i,0}} x_{i,1}+\\dots+\\beta_p \\sum_{i=1}^n \\phantom{x_{i,0}} x_{i,p} &amp;=&amp;\\sum_{i=1}^n\\phantom{x_{i,0}} y_i \\\\ \\beta_0 \\sum_{i=1}^n x_{i,1} + \\beta_1\\sum_{i=1}^n x_{i,1} x_{i,1}+\\dots+\\beta_p \\sum_{i=1}^n x_{i,1} x_{i,p} &amp;=&amp;\\sum_{i=1}^n x_{i,1} y_i \\\\ \\vdots\\\\ \\beta_0 \\sum_{i=1}^n x_{i,p} + \\beta_1\\sum_{i=1}^n x_{i,p} x_{i,1}+\\dots+\\beta_p \\sum_{i=1}^n x_{i,p} x_{i,p} &amp;=&amp;\\sum_{i=1}^n x_{i,p} y_i \\\\ \\end{array} \\right. \\] can be rewritten in matrix terms as: \\[ \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{rcl} \\beta_0 \\mathbf{\\dot{x}}_{\\cdot,0}^T \\mathbf{\\dot{x}}_{\\cdot,0} + \\beta_1 \\mathbf{\\dot{x}}_{\\cdot,0}^T \\mathbf{\\dot{x}}_{\\cdot,1}+\\dots+\\beta_p \\mathbf{\\dot{x}}_{\\cdot,0}^T \\mathbf{\\dot{x}}_{\\cdot,p} &amp;=&amp; \\mathbf{\\dot{x}}_{\\cdot,0}^T \\mathbf{y} \\\\ \\beta_0 \\mathbf{\\dot{x}}_{\\cdot,1}^T \\mathbf{\\dot{x}}_{\\cdot,0} + \\beta_1 \\mathbf{\\dot{x}}_{\\cdot,1}^T \\mathbf{\\dot{x}}_{\\cdot,1}+\\dots+\\beta_p \\mathbf{\\dot{x}}_{\\cdot,1}^T \\mathbf{\\dot{x}}_{\\cdot,p} &amp;=&amp; \\mathbf{\\dot{x}}_{\\cdot,1}^T \\mathbf{y} \\\\ \\vdots\\\\ \\beta_0 \\mathbf{\\dot{x}}_{\\cdot,p}^T \\mathbf{\\dot{x}}_{\\cdot,0} + \\beta_1 \\mathbf{\\dot{x}}_{\\cdot,p}^T \\mathbf{\\dot{x}}_{\\cdot,1}+\\dots+\\beta_p \\mathbf{\\dot{x}}_{\\cdot,p}^T \\mathbf{\\dot{x}}_{\\cdot,p} &amp;=&amp; \\mathbf{\\dot{x}}_{\\cdot,p}^T \\mathbf{y}\\\\ \\end{array} \\right. \\] This can be restated as: \\[ \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{rcl} \\left(\\mathbf{\\dot{x}}_{\\cdot,0}^T \\mathbf{\\dot{X}}\\right)\\, \\boldsymbol\\beta &amp;=&amp; \\mathbf{\\dot{x}}_{\\cdot,0}^T \\mathbf{y} \\\\ \\left(\\mathbf{\\dot{x}}_{\\cdot,1}^T \\mathbf{\\dot{X}}\\right)\\, \\boldsymbol\\beta &amp;=&amp; \\mathbf{\\dot{x}}_{\\cdot,1}^T \\mathbf{y} \\\\ \\vdots\\\\ \\left(\\mathbf{\\dot{x}}_{\\cdot,p}^T \\mathbf{\\dot{X}}\\right)\\, \\boldsymbol\\beta &amp;=&amp; \\mathbf{\\dot{x}}_{\\cdot,p}^T \\mathbf{y}\\\\ \\end{array} \\right. \\] which in turn is equivalent to: \\[ \\left(\\mathbf{\\dot{X}}^T\\mathbf{X}\\right)\\,\\boldsymbol\\beta = \\mathbf{\\dot{X}}^T\\mathbf{y}. \\] Such a system of linear equations in matrix form can be solved numerically using, amongst others, the solve() function. (***) In practice, we’d rather rely on QR or SVD decompositions of matrices for efficiency and numerical accuracy reasons.

With each input point \\(\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot}\\) we associate the desired output \\(y_i\\). In this chapter we are interested in classification tasks; we assume that each \\(y_i\\) is a label (e.g., a character string). Most commonly, we are faced with binary classification tasks where there are only two possible distinct labels. We traditionally denote them with \\(0\\)s and \\(1\\)s. For example: 0 1 no yes false true failure success healthy ill On the other hand, in multiclass classification, we assume that each \\(y_i\\) takes more than two possible values. 3.1.2 Factor Data Type On a side note (see the Appendix for more details), factor type in R is a very convenient means to store categorical data, and hence, to encode the data in \\(\\mathbf{y}\\). x &lt;- c(&quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot;, &quot;no&quot;, &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot;) f &lt;- factor(x, levels=c(&quot;no&quot;, &quot;yes&quot;)) f ## [1] yes no no yes no ## Levels: no yes table(f) # counts ## f ## no yes ## 3 2 Internally, objects of type factor are represented as integer vectors with elements in \\(\\{1,\\dots,M\\}\\), where \\(M\\) is the number of possible levels. Labels, used to “decipher” the numeric codes, are stored separately. as.numeric(f) # 2nd label, 1st label, 1st label etc. ## [1] 2 1 1 2 1 levels(f) ## [1] &quot;no&quot; &quot;yes&quot; levels(f) &lt;- c(&quot;failure&quot;, &quot;success&quot;) # re-encode f ## [1] success failure failure success failure ## Levels: failure success 3.1.3 Data For illustration, let’s consider the wines dataset. wines &lt;- read.csv(&quot;datasets/winequality-all.csv&quot;, comment=&quot;#&quot;) (n &lt;- nrow(wines)) # number of samples ## [1] 5320 The input matrix \\(\\mathbf{X}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times p}\\) consists of all the numeric variables: X &lt;- as.matrix(wines[,1:11]) dim(X) ## [1] 5320 11 head(X, 2) # first two rows ## fixed.acidity volatile.acidity citric.acid residual.sugar ## [1,] 7.4 0.70 0 1.9 ## [2,] 7.8 0.88 0 2.6 ## chlorides free.sulfur.dioxide total.sulfur.dioxide density ## [1,] 0.076 11 34 0.9978 ## [2,] 0.098 25 67 0.9968 ## pH sulphates alcohol ## [1,] 3.51 0.56 9.4 ## [2,] 3.20 0.68 9.8 The response variable is an ordinal one, giving each wine’s rating as assigned by a sommelier. Here: 0 == a very bad wine, 10 == a very good one. We will convert this dependent variable to a binary one: 0 == response &lt; 5 == bad 1 == response &gt;= 5 == good # recall that TRUE == 1 Y &lt;- factor(as.numeric(wines$response &gt;= 5)) table(Y) ## Y ## 0 1 ## 4311 1009 Now \\((\\mathbf{X},\\mathbf{y})\\) is a basis for an interesting binary classification task. 3.1.4 Training and Test Sets Recall that we are genuinely interested in the construction of supervised learning models for the two following purposes: description – to explain a given dataset in simpler terms, prediction – to forecast the values of the dependent variable for inputs that are yet to be observed. In the latter case: we want our models to generalise well to new data, we don’t want our models to overfit to current data. One way to assess if a model has sufficient predictive power is based on a random train-test split of the original dataset: training sample (usually 60-80% of the observations) – used to construct a model, test sample (remaining 40-20%) – used to assess the goodness of fit. Test sample must not be used in the training phase! (No cheating!) 70/30% train-test split in R: set.seed(123) # reproducibility matters random_indices &lt;- sample(n) head(random_indices) # preview ## [1] 2463 2511 2227 526 4291 2986 # first 70% of the indices (they are arranged randomly) # will constitute the train sample: train_indices &lt;- random_indices[1:floor(n*0.7)] X_train &lt;- X[train_indices,] Y_train &lt;- Y[train_indices] # the remaining indices (30%) go to the test sample: X_test &lt;- X[-train_indices,] Y_test &lt;- Y[-train_indices] 3.1.5 Discussed Methods We will discuss 3 simple and educational (yet practically useful) classification algorithms: K-nearest neighbour scheme – this chapter, Decision trees – the next chapter, Logistic regression – the next chapter.

To classify a new point \\(\\mathbf{x}&#39;\\): find the \\(K\\) nearest neighbours of a given point \\(\\mathbf{x}&#39;\\) amongst the points in the train set, denoted \\(\\mathbf{x}_{i_1,\\cdot}, \\dots, \\mathbf{x}_{i_K,\\cdot}\\): compute the Euclidean distances between \\(\\mathbf{x}&#39;\\) and each \\(\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot}\\) form the train set, \\[d_i = \\|\\mathbf{x}&#39;-\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot}\\|\\] order \\(d_i\\)s in increasing order, \\(d_{i_1} \\le d_{i_2} \\le \\dots \\le d_{i_K}\\) pick first \\(K\\) indices (these are the nearest neighbours) fetch the corresponding reference labels \\(y_{i_1}, \\dots, y_{i_K}\\) return their mode as a result, i.e., the most frequently occurring label (a.k.a. majority vote) 3.2.2 Example in R We shall be calling the knn() function from package FNN to classify the points from the test sample extracted from the wines dataset: library(&quot;FNN&quot;) Let us make prediction using the 5-nn classifier: Y_knn5 &lt;- knn(X_train, X_test, Y_train, k=5) head(Y_test, 28) # True Ys ## [1] 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## Levels: 0 1 head(Y_knn5, 28) # Predicted Ys ## [1] 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## Levels: 0 1 mean(Y_test == Y_knn5) # accuracy ## [1] 0.7896055 10-nn classifier: Y_knn10 &lt;- knn(X_train, X_test, Y_train, k=10) head(Y_test, 28) # True Ys ## [1] 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## Levels: 0 1 head(Y_knn10, 28) # Predicted Ys ## [1] 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## Levels: 0 1 mean(Y_test == Y_knn10) # accuracy ## [1] 0.8008766 3.2.3 Different Metrics (*) The Euclidean distance is just one particular example of many possible metrics. Mathematically, we say that \\(d\\) is a metric on a set \\(X\\) (e.g., \\(\\mathbb{R}^p\\)), whenever it is a function \\(d:X\\times X\\to [0,\\infty]\\) such that for all \\(x,x&#39;,x&#39;&#39;\\in X\\): \\(d(x, x&#39;) = 0\\) if and only if \\(x=x&#39;\\), \\(d(x, x&#39;) = d(x&#39;, x)\\) (it is symmetric) \\(d(x, x&#39;&#39;) \\le d(x, x&#39;) + d(x&#39;, x&#39;&#39;)\\) (it fulfils the triangle inequality) (*) Not all the properties are required in all the applications; sometimes we might need a few additional ones. We can easily generalise the way we introduced the K-NN method to have a classifier that is based on a point’s neighbourhood with respect to any metric. Example metrics on \\(\\mathbb{R}^p\\): Euclidean \\[ d_2(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{x}&#39;) = \\| \\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{x}&#39; \\| = \\| \\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{x}&#39; \\|_2 = \\sqrt{ \\sum_{i=1}^p (x_i-x_i&#39;)^2 } \\] Manhattan (taxicab) \\[ d_1(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{x}&#39;) = \\| \\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{x}&#39; \\|_1 = { \\sum_{i=1}^p |x_i-x_i&#39;| } \\] Chebyshev (maximum) \\[ d_\\infty(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{x}&#39;) = \\| \\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{x}&#39; \\|_\\infty = \\max_{i=1,\\dots,p} |x_i-x_i&#39;| \\] We can define metrics on different spaces too. For example, the Levenshtein distance is a popular choice for comparing character strings (also DNA sequences etc.) It is an edit distance – it measures the minimal number of single-character insertions, deletions or substitutions to change one string into another. For instance: adist(&quot;happy&quot;, &quot;nap&quot;) ## [,1] ## [1,] 3 This is because we need 1 substitution and 2 deletions, happy → nappy → napp → nap. See also: the Hamming distance for categorical vectors (or strings of equal lengths), the Jaccard distance for sets, the Kendall tau rank distance for rankings. Moreover, R package stringdist includes implementations of numerous string metrics. 3.2.4 Standardisation of Independent Variables Note that the Euclidean distance that we used above implicitly assumes that every feature (independent variable) is on the same scale. However, when dealing with, e.g., physical quantities, we often perform conversions of units of measurement (kg → g, feet → m etc.). Transforming a single feature may drastically change the metric structure of the dataset and therefore highly affect the obtained predictions. To “bring data to the same scale”, we often apply a trick called standardization. Computing the so-called Z-scores of the \\(j\\)-th feature, \\(\\mathbf{x}_{\\cdot,j}\\), is done by subtracting from each observation the sample mean and dividing the result by the sample standard deviation: \\[z_{i,j} = \\frac{x_{i,j}-\\bar{x}_{\\cdot,j}}{s_{x_{\\cdot,j}}}\\] This a new feature \\(\\mathbf{z}_{\\cdot,j}\\) that always has mean 0 and standard deviation of 1. Moreover, it is unit-less (e.g., we divide a value in kgs by a value in kgs, the units are cancelled out). Z-scores are easy to interpret, e.g., 0.5 denotes an observation that is 0.5 standard deviations above the mean. Let us compute Z_train and Z_test, being the standardised versions of X_train and X_test, respectively. means &lt;- apply(X, 2, mean) # column means sds &lt;- apply(X, 2, sd) # column standard deviations Z_train &lt;- X_train # to be done Z_test &lt;- X_test # to be done for (j in 1:ncol(X)) { Z_train[,j] &lt;- (Z_train[,j]-means[j])/sds[j] Z_test[,j] &lt;- (Z_test[,j] -means[j])/sds[j] } Alternatively: Z_train &lt;- t(apply(X_train, 1, function(c) (c-means)/sds)) Z_test &lt;- t(apply(X_test, 1, function(c) (c-means)/sds)) Let us compute the accuracy of K-NN classifiers acting on standardised data.

["implementing-a-k-nn-classifier.html", "3.3 Implementing a K-NN Classifier (*)", " 3.3 Implementing a K-NN Classifier (*) 3.3.1 Main Routine (*) Let us implement a K-NN classifier ourselves by using a top-bottom approach. We will start with a general description of the admissible inputs and the expected output. Then we will arrange the processing of data into conveniently manageable chunks. The function’s declaration will look like: our_knn &lt;- function(X_train, X_test, Y_train, k=1) { # k=1 denotes a parameter with a default value # ... } First, we should specify the type and form of the arguments we’re expecting: # this is the body of our_knn() - part 1 stopifnot(is.numeric(X_train), is.matrix(X_train)) stopifnot(is.numeric(X_test), is.matrix(X_test)) stopifnot(is.factor(Y_train)) stopifnot(ncol(X_train) == ncol(X_test)) stopifnot(nrow(X_train) == length(Y_train)) stopifnot(k &gt;= 1) n_train &lt;- nrow(X_train) n_test &lt;- nrow(X_test) p &lt;- ncol(X_train) M &lt;- length(levels(Y_train)) Therefore, \\(\\mathtt{X\\_train}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{\\mathtt{n\\_train}\\times \\mathtt{p}}\\), \\(\\mathtt{X\\_test}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{\\mathtt{n\\_test}\\times \\mathtt{p}}\\) and \\(\\mathtt{Y\\_train}\\in\\{1,\\dots,M\\}^{\\mathtt{n\\_train}}\\) Recall that R factor objects are internally encoded as integer vectors. Next, we will call the (to-be-done) function our_get_knnx(), which seeks nearest neighbours of all the points: # our_get_knnx returns a matrix nn_indices of size n_test*k, # where nn_indices[i,j] denotes the index of # X_test[i,]&#39;s j-th nearest neighbour in X_train. # (It is the point X_train[nn_indices[i,j],]). nn_indices &lt;- our_get_knnx(X_train, X_test, k) Then, for each point in X_test, we fetch the labels corresponding to its nearest neighbours and compute their mode: Y_pred &lt;- numeric(n_test) # vector of length n_test # For now we will operate on the integer labels in {1,...,M} Y_train_int &lt;- as.numeric(Y_train) for (i in 1:n_test) { # Get the labels of the NNs of the i-th point: nn_labels_i &lt;- Y_train_int[nn_indices[i,]] # Compute the mode (majority vote): Y_pred[i] &lt;- our_mode(nn_labels_i) # in {1,...,M} } Finally, we should convert the resulting integer vector to an object of type factor: # Convert Y_pred to factor: return(factor(Y_pred, labels=levels(Y_train))) 3.3.2 Mode To implement the mode, we can use the tabulate() function. Read the function’s man page, see ?tabulate. For example: tabulate(c(1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 5, 2)) ## [1] 4 2 0 0 1 There might be multiple modes – in such a case, we should pick one at random. For that, we can use the sample() function. Read the function’s man page, see ?sample. Note that its behaviour is different when it’s first argument is a vector of length 1. An example implementation: our_mode &lt;- function(Y) { # tabulate() will take care of # checking the correctness of Y t &lt;- tabulate(Y) mode_candidates &lt;- which(t == max(t)) if (length(mode_candidates) == 1) return(mode_candidates) else return(sample(mode_candidates, 1)) } our_mode(c(1, 1, 1, 1)) ## [1] 1 our_mode(c(2, 2, 2, 2)) ## [1] 2 our_mode(c(3, 1, 3, 3)) ## [1] 3 our_mode(c(1, 1, 3, 3, 2)) ## [1] 3 our_mode(c(1, 1, 3, 3, 2)) ## [1] 1 3.3.3 NN Search Routines (*) Last but not least, we should implement the our_get_knnx() function. It is the function responsible for seeking the indices of nearest neighbours. It turns out this function will actually constitute the K-NN classifier’s performance bottleneck in case of big data samples. # our_get_knnx returns a matrix nn_indices of size n_test*k, # where nn_indices[i,j] denotes the index of # X_test[i,]&#39;s j-th nearest neighbour in X_train. # (It is the point X_train[nn_indices[i,j],]). our_get_knnx &lt;- function(X_train, X_test, k) { # ... } A naive approach to our_get_knnx() relies on computing all pairwise distances, and sorting them. our_get_knnx &lt;- function(X_train, X_test, k) { n_test &lt;- nrow(X_test) nn_indices &lt;- matrix(NA_real_, nrow=n_test, ncol=k) for (i in 1:n_test) { d &lt;- apply(X_train, 1, function(x) sqrt(sum((x-X_test[i,])^2))) # now d[j] is the distance # between X_train[j,] and X_test[i,] nn_indices[i,] &lt;- order(d)[1:k] } nn_indices } A comparison with FNN:knn(): system.time(Ya &lt;- knn(X_train, X_test, Y_train, k=5)) ## user system elapsed ## 0.251 0.000 0.251 system.time(Yb &lt;- our_knn(X_train, X_test, Y_train, k=5)) ## user system elapsed ## 44.054 0.038 45.748 mean(Ya == Yb) # 1.0 on perfect match ## [1] 1 Both functions return identical results but our implementation is “slightly” slower. FNN:knn() is efficiently written in C++, which is a compiled programming language. R, on the other hand (just like Python and Matlab) is interpreted, therefore as a rule of thumb we should consider it an order of magnitude slower (see, however, the Julia language). Let us substitute our naive implementation with the equivalent one, but written in C++ (available in the FNN package). (*) Note that we could write a C++ implementation ourselves, see the Rcpp package for seamless R and C++ integration. our_get_knnx &lt;- function(X_train, X_test, k) { # this is used by our_knn() FNN::get.knnx(X_train, X_test, k, algorithm=&quot;brute&quot;)$nn.index } system.time(Ya &lt;- knn(X_train, X_test, Y_train, k=5)) ## user system elapsed ## 0.309 0.000 0.308 system.time(Yb &lt;- our_knn(X_train, X_test, Y_train, k=5)) ## user system elapsed ## 0.141 0.000 0.142 mean(Ya == Yb) # 1.0 on perfect match ## [1] 1 Note that our solution requires \\(c\\cdot n_\\text{test}\\cdot n_\\text{train}\\cdot p\\) arithmetic operations for some \\(c&gt;1\\). The overall cost of sorting is at least \\(d\\cdot n_\\text{test}\\cdot n_\\text{train}\\cdot\\log n_\\text{train}\\) for some \\(d&gt;1\\). This does not scale well with both \\(n_\\text{test}\\) and \\(n_\\text{train}\\) (think – big data). It turns out that there are special spatial data structures – such as metric trees – that aim to speed up searching for nearest neighbours in low-dimensional spaces (for small \\(p\\)). (*) Searching in high-dimensional spaces is hard due to the so-called curse of dimensionality. For example, FNN::get.knnx() also implements the so-called kd-trees. library(&quot;microbenchmark&quot;) test_speed &lt;- function(n, p, k) { A &lt;- matrix(runif(n*p), nrow=n, ncol=p) s &lt;- summary(microbenchmark( brute=FNN::get.knnx(A, A, k, algorithm=&quot;brute&quot;), kd_tree=FNN::get.knnx(A, A, k, algorithm=&quot;kd_tree&quot;), times=3 ), unit=&quot;s&quot;) # minima of 3 time measurements: structure(s$min, names=as.character(s$expr)) } test_speed(10000, 2, 5) ## brute kd_tree ## 0.82655346 0.02878045 test_speed(10000, 5, 5) ## brute kd_tree ## 1.2348245 0.1320792 test_speed(10000, 10, 5) ## brute kd_tree ## 4.589286 1.719830 test_speed(10000, 20, 5) ## brute kd_tree ## 10.20877 38.18202 "],

For example: 0 1 no yes false true failure success healthy ill 4.1.2 Data For illustration, let’s consider the wines dataset again. wines &lt;- read.csv(&quot;datasets/winequality-all.csv&quot;, comment=&quot;#&quot;) (n &lt;- nrow(wines)) # number of samples ## [1] 5320 The input matrix \\(\\mathbf{X}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times p}\\) consists of all the numeric variables: X &lt;- as.matrix(wines[,1:11]) dim(X) ## [1] 5320 11 head(X, 2) # first two rows ## fixed.acidity volatile.acidity citric.acid residual.sugar ## [1,] 7.4 0.70 0 1.9 ## [2,] 7.8 0.88 0 2.6 ## chlorides free.sulfur.dioxide total.sulfur.dioxide density ## [1,] 0.076 11 34 0.9978 ## [2,] 0.098 25 67 0.9968 ## pH sulphates alcohol ## [1,] 3.51 0.56 9.4 ## [2,] 3.20 0.68 9.8 The response variable is an ordinal one, giving each wine’s rating as assigned by a sommelier.

Let \\(\\hat{y}_i\\) denote the classifier’s output for a given \\(\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot}\\). Ideally, we’d wish that \\(\\hat{y}_i=y_i\\). Sadly, in practice we will make errors. Here are the 4 possible situations (true vs. predicted label): . \\(y_i=0\\) \\(y_i=1\\) \\(\\hat{y}_i=0\\) True Negative False Negative (Type II error) \\(\\hat{y}_i=1\\) False Positive (Type I error) True Positive Note that the terms positive and negative refer to the classifier’s output, i.e., occur when \\(\\hat{y}_i\\) is equal to \\(1\\) and \\(0\\), respectively.

Think of medical applications, e.g., HIV testing or tumour diagnosis. In such a case, accuracy as a metric fails to quantify what we are aiming for. If only 1% of the cases have true \\(y_i=1\\), then a dummy classifier that always outputs \\(\\hat{y}_i=0\\) has 99% accuracy. Metrics such as precision and recall (and their aggregated version, F-measure) aim to address this problem.

We haven’t yet considered the question which \\(K\\) yields the best classifier. Best == one that has the highest predictive power. Best == with respect to some chosen metric (accuracy, recall, precision, F-measure, …) Let us study how the metrics on the test set change as functions of the number of nearest neighbours considered, \\(K\\). Auxiliary function: knn_metrics &lt;- function(k, X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test) { Y_pred &lt;- knn(X_train, X_test, Y_train, k=k) # classify get_metrics(Y_test, Y_pred) } For example: knn_metrics(5, Z_train, Z_test, Y_train, Y_test) ## Acc Prec Rec F ## 0.8215404 0.5234657 0.4865772 0.5043478 ## TN FN FP TP ## 1167.0000000 153.0000000 132.0000000 145.0000000 Example call to evaluate metrics as a function of different \\(K\\)s: Ks &lt;- 1:10 Ps &lt;- as.data.frame(t( sapply(Ks, # on each element in this vector knn_metrics, # apply this function Z_train, Z_test, Y_train, Y_test # aux args ))) Note that sapply(X, f, arg1, arg2, ...) outputs a list Y such that Y[[i]] = f(X[i], arg1, arg2, ...) which is then simplified to a matrix. We transpose this result, t(), in order to get each metric corresponding to different columns in the result. As usual, if you keep wondering, e.g., why t(), play with the code yourself – it’s fun fun fun.

Should we standardise the dataset? Which variables should be taken into account when computing the Euclidean metric? Which metric should be used? If we select the best hyperparameter set based on test sample error, we will run into the trap of overfitting again. This time we’ll be overfitting to the test set — the model that is optimal for a given test sample doesn’t have to generalise well to other test samples (!). In order to overcome this problem, we can perform a random train-validation-test split of the original dataset: training sample (e.g., 60%) – used to construct the models validation sample (e.g., 20%) – used to tune the hyperparameters of the classifier test sample (e.g., 20%) – used to assess the goodness of fit (*) If our dataset is too small, we can use various crossvalidation techniques instead of a train-validate-test split. An example way to perform a train-validation-test split: set.seed(123) # reproducibility matters random_indices &lt;- sample(n) n1 &lt;- floor(n*0.6) n2 &lt;- floor(n*0.8) X2_train &lt;- X[1:n1,] Y2_train &lt;- Y[1:n1] X2_valid &lt;- X[(n1+1):n2,] Y2_valid &lt;- Y[(n1+1):n2] X2_test &lt;- X[(n2+1):n,] Y2_test &lt;- Y[(n2+1):n] stopifnot(nrow(X2_train)+nrow(X2_valid)+nrow(X2_test) == nrow(X)) "],
["decision-trees.html", "4.3 Decision Trees", " 4.3 Decision Trees 4.3.1 Introduction Note that a K-NN classifier is model-free. The whole training set must be stored and referred to at all times. Therefore, it doesn’t explain the data we have – we may use it solely for the purpose of prediction. Perhaps one of the most interpretable (and hence human-friendly) models consist of decision rules of the form: IF \\(x_{i,j_1}\\le v_1\\) AND … AND \\(x_{i,j_r}\\le v_r\\) THEN \\(\\hat{y}_i=1\\). These can be organised into a hierarchy for greater readability. This idea inspired the notion of decision trees (Breiman et al. 1984). Each tree node reports 3 pieces of information: dominating class (0 or 1) (relative) proportion of 1s represented in a node (absolute) proportion of all observations in a node 4.3.2 Example in R We will use the rpart() function from the rpart package to build a classification tree. library(&quot;rpart&quot;) library(&quot;rpart.plot&quot;) set.seed(123) rpart() uses a formula (~) interface, hence it will be easier to feed it with data in a data.frame form.

["binary-logistic-regression.html", "4.4 Binary Logistic Regression", " 4.4 Binary Logistic Regression 4.4.1 Motivation Recall that for a regression task, we fitted a very simple family of models – the linear ones – by minimising the sum of squared residuals. This approach was pretty effective. Theoretically, we could treat the class labels as numeric \\(0\\)s and \\(1\\)s and apply regression models in a binary classification task.

This could also provide us with the confidence in our prediction. Probability is a number in \\([0,1]\\), but \\(Y\\in \\mathbb{R}\\). However, we could transform the real-valued outputs by means of some function \\(\\phi:\\mathbb{R}\\to[0,1]\\) (preferably S-shaped == sigmoid), so as to get: \\(\\Pr(Y=1|\\mathbf{X},\\boldsymbol\\beta)=\\phi(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2 + \\dots + \\beta_p X_p)\\) The above reads as “Probability that \\(Y\\) is from class 1 given \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol\\beta\\)”. A popular choice is the logistic sigmoid function, \\[ \\phi(y) = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-y}} = \\frac{e^y}{1+e^y} \\] Hence our model becomes: \\[ Y=\\frac{1}{1+e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2 + \\dots + \\beta_p X_p)}} \\] We call it a generalised linear model (glm). 4.4.3 Example in R Let us first fit a simple (i.e., \\(p=1\\)) logistic regression model using the alcohol variable. “logit” below denotes the inverse of the logistic sigmoid function. f &lt;- glm(Y~alcohol, data=XY_train, family=binomial(&quot;logit&quot;)) summary(f) ## ## Call: ## glm(formula = Y ~ alcohol, family = binomial(&quot;logit&quot;), data = XY_train) ## ## Deviance Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -1.8703 -0.5994 -0.3984 -0.2770 2.7463 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

In the ordinary regression, we use the squared residual \\(e(\\hat{y}, y) = (\\hat{y}-y)^2\\). In logistic regression (the kind of a classifier we are interested in right now), we use the cross-entropy (a.k.a. log-loss), \\[ e(\\hat{y},y) = - \\left(y\\log \\hat{y} + (1-y)\\log(1-\\hat{y})\\right) \\] The corresponding loss function has not only nice statistical properties (**) but also an intuitive interpretation. Note that the predicted \\(\\hat{y}\\) is in \\((0,1)\\) and the true \\(y\\) equals to either 0 or 1. Recall also that \\(\\log t\\in(-\\infty, 0)\\) for \\(t\\in (0,1)\\). \\[ e(\\hat{y},y) = - \\left(y\\log \\hat{y} + (1-y)\\log(1-\\hat{y})\\right) \\] if true \\(y=1\\), then the penalty becomes \\(e(\\hat{y}, 1) = -\\log(\\hat{y})\\) \\(\\hat{y}\\) is the probability that the classified input is indeed from class \\(1\\) we’d be happy if the classifier outputted \\(\\hat{y}\\simeq 1\\) in this case; this is not penalised as \\(-\\log(t)\\to 0\\) as \\(t\\to 1\\) however, if the classifier is totally wrong, i.e., it thinks that \\(\\hat{y}\\simeq 0\\), then the penalty will be very high, as \\(-\\log(t)\\to+\\infty\\) as \\(t\\to 0\\) if true \\(y=0\\), then the penalty becomes \\(e(\\hat{y}, 0) = -\\log(1-\\hat{y})\\) \\(1-\\hat{y}\\) is the predicted probability that the input is from class \\(0\\) we penalise heavily the case where \\(1-\\hat{y}\\) is small (we’d be happy if the classifier was sure that \\(1-\\hat{y}\\simeq 1\\), because this is the ground-truth) (*) Interestingly, there is no analytical formula for the optimal set of parameters (\\(\\beta_0,\\beta_1,\\dots,\\beta_p\\)) minimising the log-loss. In the chapter on optimisation, we shall see that the solution to the logistic regression can be solved numerically by means of quite simple iterative algorithms. "],

Interestingly, in the next chapter we will note that the logistic regression model is a special case of a feed-forward single layer neural network. We will also generalise the binary logistic regression to the case of a multiclass classification. The state-of-the art classifiers called Random Forests and XGBoost (see also: AdaBoost) are based on decision trees. They tend to be more accurate but – at the same time – they fail to exhibit the decision trees’ important feature: interpretability.

It holds: \\[ \\begin{array}{ll} \\Pr(Y=1|\\mathbf{X},\\boldsymbol\\beta)=&amp;\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{1+e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\dots + \\beta_p X_p)}}\\\\ \\Pr(Y=0|\\mathbf{X},\\boldsymbol\\beta)=&amp;\\displaystyle\\frac{e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\dots + \\beta_p X_p)}}{1+e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\dots + \\beta_p X_p)}}\\\\ \\end{array} \\] The fitting of the model was performed by minimising the cross-entropy (log-loss): \\[ \\min_{\\boldsymbol\\beta\\in\\mathbb{R}^{p+1}} -\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(y_i\\log \\Pr(Y=1|\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot},\\boldsymbol\\beta) + (1-y_i)\\log \\Pr(Y=0|\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot},\\boldsymbol\\beta)\\right). \\] Note that for each \\(i\\), either the left or the right term (in the bracketed expression) vanishes. Hence, we may also write the above as: \\[ \\min_{\\boldsymbol\\beta\\in\\mathbb{R}^{p+1}} -\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\log \\Pr(Y=y_i|\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot},\\boldsymbol\\beta). \\] In this chapter we will generalise the binary logistic regression model: First we will consider the case of multiclass classification. Then we will note that multinomial logistic regression is a special case of a feed-forward neural network. 5.1.2 Data We will study the famous classic – the MNIST image classification dataset. == Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database, see http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ It consists of 28×28 pixel images of handwritten digits: train: 60,000 training images, t10k: 10,000 testing images. There are 10 unique digits, so this is a multiclass classification problem. The dataset is already “too easy” for testing of the state-of-the-art classifiers (see the notes below), but it’s a great educational example. A few image instances from each class: Accessing MNIST via the keras package (which we will use throughout this chapter anyway) is easy: library(&quot;keras&quot;) mnist &lt;- dataset_mnist() X_train &lt;- mnist$train$x Y_train &lt;- mnist$train$y X_test &lt;- mnist$test$x Y_test &lt;- mnist$test$y X_train and X_test consist of 28×28 pixel images. dim(X_train) ## [1] 60000 28 28 dim(X_test) ## [1] 10000 28 28 X_train and X_test are 3-dimensional arrays, think of them as vectors of 60000 and 10000 matrices of size 28×28, respectively. These are greyscale images, with 0 = black, …, 255 = white: range(X_train) ## [1] 0 255 It is better to convert the colour values to 0.0 = black, …, 1.0 = white: X_train &lt;- X_train/255 X_test &lt;- X_test/255 Y_train and Y_test are the corresponding integer labels: length(Y_train) ## [1] 60000 length(Y_test) ## [1] 10000 table(Y_train) # label distribution in train sample ## Y_train ## 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ## 5923 6742 5958 6131 5842 5421 5918 6265 5851 5949 table(Y_test) # label distribution in test sample ## Y_test ## 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ## 980 1135 1032 1010 982 892 958 1028 974 1009 id &lt;- 123 # which image to show image(z=t(X_train[id,,]), col=grey.colors(256, 0, 1), axes=FALSE, asp=1, ylim=c(1, 0)) legend(&quot;topleft&quot;, bg=&quot;white&quot;, legend=sprintf(&quot;True label=%d&quot;, Y_train[id])) "],
["multinomial-logistic-regression.html", "5.2 Multinomial Logistic Regression", " 5.2 Multinomial Logistic Regression 5.2.1 A Note on Data Representation So… you may now be wondering “how do we construct an image classifier, this seems so complicated!”. For a computer, (almost) everything is just numbers. Instead of playing with \\(n\\) matrices, each of size 28×28, we may “flatten” the images so as to get \\(n\\) “long” vectors of length \\(p=784\\). X_train2 &lt;- matrix(X_train, ncol=28*28) X_test2 &lt;- matrix(X_test, ncol=28*28) The classifiers studied here do not take the “spatial” positioning of the pixels into account anyway. (*) See, however, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), e.g., in (Goodfellow et al. 2016). Hence, now we’re back to our “comfort zone”. 5.2.2 Extending Logistic Regression Let us generalise the binary logistic regression model to a 10-class one (or, more generally, \\(K\\)-class one). This time we will be modelling ten probabilities, with \\(\\Pr(Y=k|\\mathbf{X},\\mathbf{B})\\) denoting the confidence that a given image \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) is in fact the \\(k\\)-th digit: \\[ \\begin{array}{lcl} \\Pr(Y=0|\\mathbf{X},\\mathbf{B})&amp;=&amp;\\dots\\\\ \\Pr(Y=1|\\mathbf{X},\\mathbf{B})&amp;=&amp;\\dots\\\\ &amp;\\vdots&amp;\\\\ \\Pr(Y=9|\\mathbf{X},\\mathbf{B})&amp;=&amp;\\dots\\\\ \\end{array} \\] where \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) is the set of underlying model parameters (to be determined soon). In binary logistic regression, the class probabilities are obtained by “cleverly normalising” the outputs of a linear model (so that we obtain a value in \\([0,1]\\)). In the multinomial case, we can use a separate linear model for each digit so that \\(\\Pr(Y=k|\\mathbf{X},\\mathbf{B})\\) is given as a function of \\[\\beta_{0,k} + \\beta_{1,k} X_{1} + \\dots + \\beta_{p,k} X_{p}.\\] Therefore, instead of a parameter vector of length \\((p+1)\\), we will need a parameter matrix of size \\((p+1)\\times 10\\) representing the model’s definition. Side note: upper case of \\(\\beta\\) is \\(B\\). Then, these 10 numbers will have to be normalised so as to they are positive and sum to \\(1\\). To maintain the spirit of the original model, we can apply \\(e^{-(\\beta_{0,k} + \\beta_{1,k} X_{1} + \\dots + \\beta_{p,k} X_{p})}\\) to get a positive value, because the co-domain of the exponential function \\(t\\mapsto e^t\\) is \\((0,\\infty)\\). Then, dividing each output by the sum of all the outputs will guarantee that the total sum equals 1. This leads to: \\[ \\begin{array}{lcl} \\Pr(Y=0|\\mathbf{X},\\mathbf{B})&amp;=&amp;\\displaystyle\\frac{e^{-(\\beta_{0,0} + \\beta_{1,0} X_{1} + \\dots + \\beta_{p,0} X_{p})}}{\\sum_{k=0}^9 e^{-(\\beta_{0,k} + \\beta_{1,k} X_{1} + \\dots + \\beta_{p,k} X_p)}},\\\\ \\Pr(Y=1|\\mathbf{X},\\mathbf{B})&amp;=&amp;\\displaystyle\\frac{e^{-(\\beta_{0,1} + \\beta_{1,1} X_{1} + \\dots + \\beta_{p,1} X_{p})}}{\\sum_{k=0}^9 e^{-(\\beta_{0,k} + \\beta_{1,k} X_{1} + \\dots + \\beta_{p,k} X_{p})}},\\\\ &amp;\\vdots&amp;\\\\ \\Pr(Y=9|\\mathbf{X},\\mathbf{B})&amp;=&amp;\\displaystyle\\frac{e^{-(\\beta_{0,9} + \\beta_{1,9} X_{1} + \\dots + \\beta_{p,9} X_{p})}}{\\sum_{k=0}^9 e^{-(\\beta_{0,k} + \\beta_{1,k} X_{1} + \\dots + \\beta_{p,k} X_{p})}}.\\\\ \\end{array} \\] Note that we get the binary logistic regression if we fix \\(\\beta_{0,0}=\\beta_{1,0}=\\dots=\\beta_{p,0}=0\\) as \\(e^0=1\\) and consider only the classes \\(0\\) and \\(1\\). 5.2.3 Softmax Function The above transformation (that maps 10 arbitrary real numbers to positive ones that sum to 1) is called the softmax function (or softargmax). softmax &lt;- function(T) { T2 &lt;- exp(T) # ignore the minus sign above T2/sum(T2) } round(rbind( softmax(c(0, 0, 10, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)), softmax(c(0, 0, 10, 0, 0, 0, 10, 0, 0, 0)), softmax(c(0, 0, 10, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0)), softmax(c(0, 0, 10, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 8))), 2) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9] [,10] ## [1,] 0 0 1.00 0 0 0 0.00 0 0 0.00 ## [2,] 0 0 0.50 0 0 0 0.50 0 0 0.00 ## [3,] 0 0 0.73 0 0 0 0.27 0 0 0.00 ## [4,] 0 0 0.67 0 0 0 0.24 0 0 0.09 5.2.4 One-Hot Encoding and Decoding The ten class-belongingness-degrees can be decoded to obtain a single label by simply choosing the class that is assigned the highest probability. y_pred &lt;- softmax(c(0, 0, 10, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 8)) round(y_pred, 2) # probabilities of class 0, 1, 2, ..., 9 ## [1] 0.00 0.00 0.67 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.24 0.00 0.00 0.09 which.max(y_pred)-1 # 1..10 -&gt; 0..9 ## [1] 2 which.max(y) returns an index k such that y[k]==max(y) (recall that in R the first element in a vector is at index 1). Mathematically, we denote this operation as \\(\\mathrm{arg}\\max_{k=1,\\dots,K} y_k\\). To make processing the outputs of a logistic regression model more convenient, we will apply the one-hot-encoding of the labels. Here, each label will be represented as a 0-1 probability vector – with probability 1 corresponding to the true class only. For example: y &lt;- 2 # true class (example) y2 &lt;- rep(0, 10) y2[y+1] &lt;- 1 # +1 because we need 0..9 -&gt; 1..10 y2 # one-hot-encoded y ## [1] 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 To one-hot encode the reference outputs in R, we start with a matrix of size \\(n\\times 10\\) populated with “0”s: Y_train2 &lt;- matrix(0, nrow=length(Y_train), ncol=10) Next, for every \\(i\\), we insert a “1” in the \\(i\\)-th row and the (Y_train[\\(i\\)]+1)-th column: # Note the &quot;+1&quot; 0..9 -&gt; 1..10 Y_train2[cbind(1:length(Y_train), Y_train+1)] &lt;- 1 In R, indexing a matrix A with a 2-column matrix B, i.e., A[B], allows for an easy access to A[B[1,1], B[1,2]], A[B[2,1], B[2,2]], A[B[3,1], B[3,2]], … Sanity check: head(Y_train) ## [1] 5 0 4 1 9 2 head(Y_train2) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9] [,10] ## [1,] 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 ## [2,] 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## [3,] 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 ## [4,] 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## [5,] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ## [6,] 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Let us generalise the above idea and write a function that can one-hot-encode any vector of integer labels: one_hot_encode &lt;- function(Y) { stopifnot(is.numeric(Y)) c1 &lt;- min(Y) # first class label cK &lt;- max(Y) # last class label K &lt;- cK-c1+1 # number of classes Y2 &lt;- matrix(0, nrow=length(Y), ncol=K) Y2[cbind(1:length(Y), Y-c1+1)] &lt;- 1 Y2 } Encode Y_train and Y_test: Y_train2 &lt;- one_hot_encode(Y_train) Y_test2 &lt;- one_hot_encode(Y_test) 5.2.5 Cross-entropy Revisited In essence, we will be comparing the probability vectors as generated by a classifier, \\(\\hat{Y}\\): round(y_pred, 2) ## [1] 0.00 0.00 0.67 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.24 0.00 0.00 0.09 with the one-hot-encoded true probabilities, \\(Y\\): y2 ## [1] 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 It turns out that one of the definitions of cross-entropy introduced above already handles the case of multiclass classification: \\[ E(\\mathbf{B}) = -\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\log \\Pr(Y=y_i|\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot},\\mathbf{B}). \\] The smaller the probability corresponding to the ground-truth class outputted by the classifier, the higher the penalty: To sum up, we will be solving the optimisation problem: \\[ \\min_{\\mathbf{B}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{(p+1)\\times 10}} -\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\log \\Pr(Y=y_i|\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot},\\mathbf{B}). \\] This has no analytical solution, but can be solved using iterative methods (see the chapter on optimisation). (*) Side note: A single term in the above formula, \\[ \\log \\Pr(Y=y_i|\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot},\\mathbf{B}) \\] given: y_pred – a vector of 10 probabilities generated by the model: \\[ \\left[\\Pr(Y=0|\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot},\\mathbf{B})\\ \\Pr(Y=1|\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot},\\mathbf{B})\\ \\cdots\\ \\Pr(Y=9|\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot},\\mathbf{B})\\right] \\] y2 – a one-hot-encoded version of the true label, \\(y_i\\), of the form \\[ \\left[0\\ 0\\ \\cdots\\ 0\\ 1\\ 0\\ \\cdots\\ 0\\right] \\] can be computed as: sum(y2*log(y_pred)) ## [1] -0.4078174 5.2.6 Problem Formulation in Matrix Form (**) The definition of a multinomial logistic regression model for a multiclass classification task involving classes \\(\\{1,2,\\dots,K\\}\\) is slightly bloated. Assuming that \\(\\mathbf{X}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times p}\\) is the input matrix, to compute the \\(K\\) predicted probabilities for the \\(i\\)-th input, \\[ \\left[ \\hat{y}_{i,1}\\ \\hat{y}_{i,2}\\ \\cdots\\ \\hat{y}_{i,K} \\right], \\] given a parameter matrix \\(\\mathbf{B}^{(p+1)\\times K}\\), we apply: \\[ \\begin{array}{lcl} \\hat{y}_{i,1}=\\Pr(Y=1|\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot},\\mathbf{B})&amp;=&amp;\\displaystyle\\frac{e^{\\beta_{0,1} + \\beta_{1,1} x_{i,1} + \\dots + \\beta_{p,1} x_{i,p}}}{\\sum_{k=1}^K e^{\\beta_{0,k} + \\beta_{1,k} x_{i,1} + \\dots + \\beta_{p,k} x_{i,p}}},\\\\ &amp;\\vdots&amp;\\\\ \\hat{y}_{i,K}=\\Pr(Y=K|\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot},\\mathbf{B})&amp;=&amp;\\displaystyle\\frac{e^{\\beta_{0,K} + \\beta_{1,K} x_{i,1} + \\dots + \\beta_{p,K} x_{i,p}}}{\\sum_{k=1}^K e^{\\beta_{0,k} + \\beta_{1,k} x_{i,1} + \\dots + \\beta_{p,k} x_{i,p}}}.\\\\ \\end{array} \\] We have dropped the minus sign in the exponentiation for the brevity of notation. Note that we can always map \\(b_{j,k}&#39;=-b_{j,k}\\). It turns out we can make use of matrix notation to tidy the above formulas. Denote the linear combinations prior to computing the softmax function with: \\[ \\begin{array}{lcl} t_{i,1}&amp;=&amp;\\beta_{0,1} + \\beta_{1,1} x_{i,1} + \\dots + \\beta_{p,1} x_{i,p}\\\\ &amp;\\vdots&amp;\\\\ t_{i,K}&amp;=&amp;\\beta_{0,K} + \\beta_{1,K} x_{i,1} + \\dots + \\beta_{p,K} x_{i,p}\\\\ \\end{array} \\] We have: \\(x_{i,j}\\) – \\(i\\)-th observation, \\(j\\)-th feature; \\(\\hat{y}_{i,k}\\) – \\(i\\)-th observation, \\(k\\)-th class probability; \\(\\beta_{j,k}\\) – coefficient for the \\(j\\)-th feature when computing the \\(k\\)-th class. Note that by augmenting \\(\\mathbf{\\dot{X}}=[\\boldsymbol{1}\\ \\mathbf{X}]\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times (p+1)}\\), where \\(\\dot{x}_{i,0}=1\\) and \\(\\dot{x}_{i,j}=x_{i,j}\\) for all \\(j\\ge 1\\) and all \\(i\\), we can write the above as: \\[ \\begin{array}{lclcl} t_{i,1}&amp;=&amp;\\sum_{j=0}^p \\dot{x}_{i,j}\\, \\beta_{j,1} &amp;=&amp; \\dot{\\mathbf{x}}_{i,\\cdot}\\, \\boldsymbol\\beta_{\\cdot,1}\\\\ &amp;\\vdots&amp;\\\\ t_{i,K}&amp;=&amp;\\sum_{j=0}^p \\dot{x}_{i,j}\\, \\beta_{j,K} &amp;=&amp; \\dot{\\mathbf{x}}_{i,\\cdot}\\, \\boldsymbol\\beta_{\\cdot,K}\\\\ \\end{array} \\] We can get the \\(K\\) linear combinations all at once in the form of a row vector by writing: \\[ \\left[ t_{i,1}\\ t_{i,2}\\ \\cdots\\ t_{i,K} \\right] = {\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot}}\\, \\mathbf{B} \\] Moreover, we can do that for all the \\(n\\) inputs by writing: \\[ \\mathbf{T}=\\dot{\\mathbf{X}}\\,\\mathbf{B} \\] Yes, this is a single matrix multiplication, we have \\(\\mathbf{T}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times K}\\). To obtain \\(\\hat{\\mathbf{Y}}\\), we have to apply the softmax function on every row of \\(\\mathbf{T}\\): \\[ \\hat{\\mathbf{Y}}=\\mathrm{softmax}\\left( \\dot{\\mathbf{X}}\\,\\mathbf{B} \\right). \\] That’s it. Take some time to appreciate the elegance of this notation. Methods for minimising crossentropy expressed in matrix form will be discussed in the next chapter. "],

Example activation functions that can be used in hidden (inner) layers: relu – The rectified linear unit: \\[\\psi(t)=\\max(t, 0),\\] sigmoid – The logistic sigmoid: \\[\\phi(t)=1 / (1 + \\exp(-t)),\\] tanh – The hyperbolic function: \\[\\mathrm{tanh}(t) = (\\exp(t) - \\exp(-t)) / (\\exp(t) + \\exp(-t)).\\] There is not much difference between them, but some might be more convenient to handle numerically than the others, depending on the implementation. 5.4.3 Example in R - 2 Layers 2-layer Neural Network 784-800-10 model &lt;- keras_model_sequential() layer_dense(model, units=800, activation=&#39;relu&#39;) layer_dense(model, units=10, activation=&#39;softmax&#39;) compile(model, optimizer=&#39;sgd&#39;, loss=&#39;categorical_crossentropy&#39;) fit(model, X_train2, Y_train2, epochs=5) Y_pred2 &lt;- predict(model, X_test2) Y_pred &lt;- apply(Y_pred2, 1, which.max)-1 # 1..10 -&gt; 0..9 mean(Y_test == Y_pred) # accuracy on the test set ## [1] 0.943 Performance metrics for each digit separately: i Acc Prec Rec F TN FN FP TP 0 0.9941 0.9591226 0.9816327 0.9702471 8979 18 41 962 1 0.9951 0.9729965 0.9841410 0.9785370 8834 18 31 1117 2 0.9871 0.9379243 0.9370155 0.9374697 8904 65 64 967 3 0.9862 0.9404040 0.9217822 0.9310000 8931 79 59 931 4 0.9890 0.9386318 0.9501018 0.9443320 8957 49 61 933 5 0.9862 0.9207589 0.9248879 0.9228188 9037 67 71 825 6 0.9898 0.9439834 0.9498956 0.9469303 8988 48 54 910 7 0.9877 0.9440628 0.9357977 0.9399121 8915 66 57 962 8 0.9858 0.9434968 0.9086242 0.9257322 8973 89 53 885 9 0.9850 0.9223206 0.9296333 0.9259625 8912 71 79 938 5.4.4 Example in R - 6 Layers 6-layer Deep Neural Network 784-2500-2000-1500-1000-500-10 model &lt;- keras_model_sequential() layer_dense(model, units=2500, activation=&#39;relu&#39;) layer_dense(model, units=2000, activation=&#39;relu&#39;) layer_dense(model, units=1500, activation=&#39;relu&#39;) layer_dense(model, units=1000, activation=&#39;relu&#39;) layer_dense(model, units=500, activation=&#39;relu&#39;) layer_dense(model, units=10, activation=&#39;softmax&#39;) compile(model, optimizer=&#39;sgd&#39;, loss=&#39;categorical_crossentropy&#39;) fit(model, X_train2, Y_train2, epochs=5) Y_pred2 &lt;- predict(model, X_test2) Y_pred &lt;- apply(Y_pred2, 1, which.max)-1 # 1..10 -&gt; 0..9 mean(Y_test == Y_pred) # accuracy on the test set ## [1] 0.973 Performance metrics for each digit separately: i Acc Prec Rec F TN FN FP TP 0 0.9963 0.9748238 0.9877551 0.9812468 8995 12 25 968 1 0.9969 0.9876325 0.9850220 0.9863255 8851 17 14 1118 2 0.9942 0.9831349 0.9602713 0.9715686 8951 41 17 991 3 0.9941 0.9567723 0.9861386 0.9712335 8945 14 45 996 4 0.9953 0.9804728 0.9714868 0.9759591 8999 28 19 954 5 0.9948 0.9677060 0.9742152 0.9709497 9079 23 29 869 6 0.9956 0.9750520 0.9791232 0.9770833 9018 20 24 938 7 0.9935 0.9868554 0.9494163 0.9677739 8959 52 13 976 8 0.9928 0.9659091 0.9599589 0.9629248 8993 39 33 935 9 0.9925 0.9507722 0.9762141 0.9633252 8940 24 51 985 "],

On top of that, they are not interpretable – those are merely black-boxes. Among the typical transformations of the input images we can find: normalisation of colours (setting brightness, stretching contrast, etc.), repositioning of the image (centring), deskewing (see below), denoising (e.g., by blurring). Another frequently applied technique concerns an expansion of the training data — we can add “artificially contaminated” images to the training set (e.g., slightly rotated digits) so as to be more ready to whatever will be provided in the test test. 5.5.2 Image Deskewing Deskewing of images (“straightening” of the digits) is amongst the most typical transformations that can be applied on MNIST. Unfortunately, we don’t have the necessary mathematical background to discuss this operation in very detail. Luckily, we can apply it on each image anyway.

["outro-4.html", "5.6 Outro", " 5.6 Outro 5.6.1 Remarks We have discussed a multinomial logistic regression model as a generalisation of the binary one. This in turn is a special case of feed-forward neural networks. There’s a lot of hype (again…) for deep neural networks in many applications, including vision, self-driving cars, natural language processing, speech recognition etc. Many different architectures of neural networks and types of units are being considered in theory and in practice, e.g.: convolutional neural networks apply a series of signal (e.g., image) transformations in first layers, they might actually “discover” deskewing automatically etc.; recurrent neural networks can imitate long short-term memory that can be used for speech synthesis and time series prediction. Main drawbacks of deep neural networks: learning is very slow, especially with very deep architectures (days, weeks); models are not explainable (black boxes) and hard to debug; finding good architectures is more art than science (maybe: more of a craftsmanship even); sometimes using deep neural network is just an excuse for being too lazy to do proper data cleansing and pre-processing. There are many issues and challenges that will be tackled in more advanced AI/ML courses and books, such as (Goodfellow et al. 2016). 5.6.2 Beyond MNIST The MNIST dataset is a classic, although its use in research is discouraged nowadays – the dataset is not considered challenging anymore – state of the art classifiers can reach \\(99.8\\%\\) accuracy. See Zalando’s Fashion-MNIST (by Kashif Rasul &amp; Han Xiao) at https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist for a modern replacement. Alternatively, take a look at CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 (https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) by A. Krizhevsky et al. or at ImageNet (http://image-net.org/index) for an even greater challenge. 5.6.3 Further Reading Recommended further reading: (James et al. 2017: Chapter 11) (Goodfellow et al. 2016) Other: keras package tutorials available at: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/keras/index.html and https://keras.rstudio.com "],

["introduction-10.html", "6.1 Introduction", " 6.1 Introduction 6.1.1 Optimisation Problem Mathematical optimisation (a.k.a. mathematical programming) deals with the study of algorithms to solve problems related to selecting the best element amongst the set of available alternatives. Most frequently “best” is expressed in terms of an error or goodness of fit measure: \\[ f:D\\to\\mathbb{R} \\] called an objective function. \\(D\\) is the search space (problem domain, feasible set) – if defines the set of possible solution candidates. An optimisation task deals with finding an element \\({x}\\in D\\) that minimises or maximises \\(f\\): \\[ \\min_{{x}\\in D} f({x}) \\quad\\text{or}\\quad\\max_{{x}\\in D} f({x}), \\] In this chapter, we will deal with unconstrained continuous optimisation, i.e., we will assume the search space is \\(D=\\mathbb{R}^p\\) for some \\(p\\). 6.1.2 Example Optimisation Problems in Machine Learning In multiple linear regression we were minimising the sum of squared residuals \\[ \\min_{\\beta_0, \\beta_1,\\dots, \\beta_p\\in\\mathbb{R}} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left( \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{i,1}+\\dots+\\beta_p x_{i,p} - y_i \\right)^2. \\] In binary logistic regression we were minimising the cross-entropy: \\[ \\min_{(\\beta_0, \\beta_1,\\dots, \\beta_p)\\in\\mathbb{R}^{(p+1)}} -\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(\\begin{array}{cc} y_i \\log \\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{i,1}+\\dots+\\beta_p x_{i,p}}} \\right)+\\\\ + (1-y_i)\\log \\left(\\frac{e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{i,1}+\\dots+\\beta_p x_{i,p}}}{1+e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{i,1}+\\dots+\\beta_p x_{i,p})}}\\right) \\end{array}\\right). \\] 6.1.3 Types of Minima and Maxima Note that minimising \\(f\\) is the same as maximising \\(\\bar{f}=-f\\). In other words, \\(\\min_{{x}\\in D} f({x})\\) and \\(\\max_{{x}\\in D} -f({x})\\) represent the same optimisation problems (and hence have identical solutions).   A minimum of \\(f\\) is a point \\({x}^*\\) such that \\(f({x}^*)\\le f({x})\\) for all \\({x}\\in D\\). A maximum of \\(f\\) is a point \\({x}^*\\) such that \\(f({x}^*)\\ge f({x})\\) for all \\({x}\\in D\\). Assuming that \\(D=\\mathbb{R}\\), here is an example objective function, \\(f:\\mathbb{D}\\to\\mathbb{R}\\), that has a minimum at \\({x}^*=1\\) with \\(f(x^*)=-2\\). \\(\\min_{x\\in \\mathbb{R}} f(x)=-2\\) (value of \\(f\\) at the minimum) \\(\\mathrm{arg}\\min_{x\\in \\mathbb{R}} f(x)=1\\) (location of the minimum) By definition, a minimum/maximum might not necessarily be unique. This depends on a problem. Assuming that \\(D=\\mathbb{R}\\), here is an example objective function, \\(f:\\mathbb{D}\\to\\mathbb{R}\\), that has multiple minima; every \\({x}^*\\in[1-\\sqrt{2},1+\\sqrt{2}]\\) yields \\(f(x^*)=0\\). If this was the case of some machine learning problem, it’d mean that we could have many equally well-performing models, and hence many equivalent explanations of the same phenomenon. Moreover, it may happen that a function has multiple local minima. We say that \\(f\\) has a local minimum at \\(\\mathbf{x}^+\\in D\\), if for some neighbourhood \\(B(\\mathbf{x}^+)\\) of \\(\\mathbf{x}^+\\) it holds \\(f(\\mathbf{x}^+) \\le f(\\mathbf{x})\\) for each \\(\\mathbf{x}\\in B(\\mathbf{x}^+)\\). If \\(D=\\mathbb{R}\\), by neighbourhood \\(B(x)\\) of \\(x\\) we mean an open interval centred at \\(x\\) of width \\(2r\\) for some small \\(r&gt;0\\), i.e., \\((x-r, x+r)\\) (*) If \\(D=\\mathbb{R}^p\\) (for any \\(p\\ge 1\\)), by neighbourhood \\(B(\\mathbf{x})\\) of \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) we mean an open ball centred at \\(\\mathbf{x}^+\\) of some small radius \\(r&gt;0\\), i.e., \\(\\{\\mathbf{y}: \\|\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{y}\\|&lt;r\\}\\) (read: the set of all the points with Euclidean distances to \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) less than \\(r\\)). To avoid ambiguity, the “true” minimum (a point \\({x}^*\\) such that \\(f({x}^*)\\le f({x})\\) for all \\({x}\\in D\\)) is sometimes also referred to as a global minimum. Of course, the global minimum is also a function’s local minimum. The existence of local minima is problematic as most of the optimisation methods might get stuck there and fail to return the global one. Moreover, we cannot often be sure if the result returned by an algorithm is indeed a global minimum. Maybe there exists a better solution that hasn’t been considered yet? Smooth vs non-smooth vs noisy objectives: 6.1.4 Example Objective over a 2D Domain Of course, our objective function does not necessarily have to be defined over a one-dimensional domain. For example, consider the following function: \\[ g(x_1,x_2)=\\log\\left((x_1^{2}+x_2-5)^{2}+(x_1+x_2^{2}-3)^{2}+x_1^2-1.60644\\dots\\right) \\] g &lt;- function(x1, x2) log((x1^2+x2-5)^2+(x1+x2^2-3)^2+x1^2-1.60644366086443841) x1 &lt;- seq(-5, 5, length.out=100) x2 &lt;- seq(-5, 5, length.out=100) # outer() expands two vectors to form a 2D grid # and applies a given function on each point y &lt;- outer(x1, x2, g) There are four local minima: x1 x2 f(x1,x2) 2.278005 -0.6134279 1.3564152 -2.612316 -2.3454621 1.7050788 1.798788 1.1987929 0.6954984 -1.542256 2.1564053 0.0000000 The global minimum is at \\((x_1^*, x_2^*)\\) as below: g(-1.542255693195422641930153, 2.156405289793087261832605) ## [1] 0 Let’s explore various ways of depicting \\(f\\). A contour plot: contour(x1, x2, y, las=1, nlevels=25) points(-1.54226, 2.15641, col=2, pch=3) A filled contour plot (a heatmap): filled.contour(x1, x2, y, las=1) Alternatively: image(x1, x2, y, las=1) contour(x1, x2, y, add=TRUE) A perspective plot: par(mfrow=c(1,2)) # 2 in 1 persp(x1, x2, y, las=1, phi=30, theta=-5, shade=2, border=NA) persp(x1, x2, y, las=1, phi=30, theta=75, shade=2, border=NA) As usual, depicting functions that are defined over high-dimensional (3D and higher) domains is… difficult. Usually 1D or 2D projections can give us some neat intuitions though. "],
["iterative-methods.html", "6.2 Iterative Methods", " 6.2 Iterative Methods 6.2.1 Introduction Many optimisation algorithms are built around the following scheme: starting from a random point, perform a walk, in each step deciding where to go based on the idea of where the location of the minimum seems to be. Example: cycling from the Deakin University’s Burwood Campus to the CBD not knowing the route and with GPS disabled – you’ll have to ask many people along the way, but you’ll eventually (because most people are good) get to some CBD (say, in Perth). More formally, we are interested in iterative algorithms that operate in a greedy-like fashion: \\(\\mathbf{x}^{(0)}\\) – initial guess (e.g., generated at random) for \\(i=1,...,M\\): \\(\\mathbf{x}^{(i)} = \\mathbf{x}^{(i-1)}+\\text{[guessed direction]}\\) if \\(|f(\\mathbf{x}^{(i)})-f(\\mathbf{x}^{(i-1)})| &lt; \\varepsilon\\) break return \\(\\mathbf{x}^{(i)}\\) as result   Note that there are two stopping criteria, based on: \\(M\\) = maximum number of iterations \\(\\varepsilon\\) = tolerance, e.g, \\(10^{-8}\\) 6.2.2 Example in R R has a built-in optim() function that provides an implementation of (amongst others) the BFGS method (proposed by Broyden, Fletcher, Goldfarb and Shanno in 1970). (*) BFGS uses the assumption that the objective function is smooth – the [guessed direction] is determined by computing the (partial) derivatives (or their finite-difference approximations). However, they might work well even if this is not the case. You will be able to derive similar algorithms (called quasi-Newton ones) yourself once you get to know about Taylor series approximation by taking a course on calculus. Here, we shall use the BFGS as a black-box continuous optimisation method, i.e., without going into how it has been defined (it’s too early for this). However, this will still enable us to identify a few interesting behavioural patterns. optim(par, fn, method=&quot;BFGS&quot;) where: par – an initial guess (a numeric vector of length \\(p\\)) fn – an objective function to minimise (takes a vector of length \\(p\\) on input, returns a single number) Let us minimise the \\(g\\) function defined above (the one with the 2D domain): # g needs to be rewritten to accept a 2-ary vector g_vectorised &lt;- function(x12) g(x12[1], x12[2]) # random starting point with coordinates in [-5, 5] (x12_init &lt;- runif(2, -5, 5)) ## [1] -2.124225 2.883051 res &lt;- optim(x12_init, g_vectorised, method=&quot;BFGS&quot;) res ## $par ## [1] -1.542255 2.156405 ## ## $value ## [1] 1.413092e-12 ## ## $counts ## function gradient ## 101 21 ## ## $convergence ## [1] 0 ## ## $message ## NULL par gives the location of the local minimum found value gives the value of \\(g\\) at par We can even depict the points that the algorithm is “visiting”: (*) Technically, the algorithm needs to evaluate a few more points in order to make the decision on where to go next (BFGS approximates the Hessian matrix). g_vectorised_plot &lt;- function(x12) { points(x12[1], x12[2], col=2, pch=3) # draw g(x12[1], x12[2]) # return value } contour(x1, x2, y, las=1, nlevels=25) res &lt;- optim(x12_init, g_vectorised_plot, method=&quot;BFGS&quot;) 6.2.3 Convergence to Local Optima We were lucky, because the local minimum that the algorithm has found coincides with the global minimum.

Function differentiation is an important concept – see how it’s referred to in, e.g., the Keras manual at https://keras.rstudio.com/reference/fit.html. Don’t worry though – we take our time with this – Melbourne wasn’t built in a day. Recall our \\(g\\) function defined above: \\[ g(x_1,x_2)=\\log\\left((x_1^{2}+x_2-5)^{2}+(x_1+x_2^{2}-3)^{2}+x_1^2-1.60644\\dots\\right) \\] It can be shown (*) that: \\[ \\begin{array}{ll} \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x_1}(x_1,x_2)=&amp; \\displaystyle\\frac{ 4x_1(x_1^{2}+x_2-5)+2(x_1+x_2^{2}-3)+2x_1 }{(x_1^{2}+x_2-5)^{2}+(x_1+x_2^{2}-3)^{2}+x_1^2-1.60644\\dots} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x_2}(x_1,x_2)=&amp; \\displaystyle\\frac{ 2(x_1^{2}+x_2-5)+4x_2(x_1+x_2^{2}-3) }{(x_1^{2}+x_2-5)^{2}+(x_1+x_2^{2}-3)^{2}+x_1^2-1.60644\\dots} \\end{array} \\] grad_g_vectorised &lt;- function(x) { c( 4*x[1]*(x[1]^2+x[2]-5)+2*(x[1]+x[2]^2-3)+2*x[1], 2*(x[1]^2+x[2]-5)+4*x[2]*(x[1]+x[2]^2-3) )/( (x[1]^2+x[2]-5)^2+(x[1]+x[2]^2-3)^2+x[1]^2-1.60644366086443841 ) } 6.3.2 Three Facts on the Gradient For now, we should emphasise three important facts:   Fact 1. If we are unable to derive the gradient analytically, we can rely on its finite differences approximation: \\[ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_i}(x_1,\\dots,x_p) \\simeq \\frac{ f(x_1,...,x_i+\\delta,...,x_p)-f(x_1,...,x_i,...,x_p) }{ \\delta } \\] for some small \\(\\delta&gt;0\\), say, \\(\\delta=10^{-6}\\). Example implementation: # gradient of f at x=c(x[1],...,x[p]) grad &lt;- function(f, x, delta=1e-6) { p &lt;- length(x) gf &lt;- numeric(p) # vector of length p for (i in 1:p) { xi &lt;- x xi[i] &lt;- xi[i]+delta gf[i] &lt;- f(xi) } (gf-f(x))/delta } (*) Interestingly, some modern vector/matrix algebra frameworks like TensorFlow (upon which keras is built) or PyTorch, feature methods to “derive” the gradient algorithmically (autodiff; automatic differentiation). Sanity check: grad(g_vectorised, c(-2, 2)) ## [1] -3.186485 -1.365634 grad_g_vectorised(c(-2, 2)) ## [1] -3.186485 -1.365636 grad(g_vectorised, c(-1.542255693, 2.15640528979)) ## [1] 1.058842e-05 1.981748e-05 grad_g_vectorised(c(-1.542255693, 2.15640528979)) ## [1] 4.129167e-09 3.577146e-10 BTW, there is also the grad() function in package numDeriv that might be a little more accurate (uses a different approximation). Fact 2. The gradient of \\(f\\) at \\(\\mathbf{x}\\), \\(\\nabla f(\\mathbf{x})\\), is a vector that points in the direction of the steepest slope. Minus gradient, \\(-\\nabla f(\\mathbf{x})\\), is the direction where the function decreases the fastest. (*) This can be shown by considering a function’s first-order Taylor series approximation. Therefore, in our iterative algorithm, we may try taking the direction of the minus gradient! How far in that direction? Well, a bit. We will refer to the desired step size as the learning rate, \\(\\eta\\).   This will be called the gradient descent method (GD; Cauchy, 1847). Fact 3. If a function \\(f\\) has a local minimum at \\(\\mathbf{x}^*\\), then \\(\\nabla {f}(\\mathbf{x}^*)=[0,\\dots,0]\\).   (***) More generally, a twice-differentiable function has a local minimum at \\(\\mathbf{x}^*\\) if and only if its gradient vanishes there and \\(\\nabla^2 {f}(\\mathbf{x}^*)\\) (Hessian matrix = matrix of all second-order derivatives) is positive-definite. 6.3.3 Gradient Descent Algorithm (GD) An implementation of the gradient descent algorithm: # par - initial guess # fn - a function to be minimised # gr - a function to return the gradient of fn # eta - learning rate # maxit - maximum number of iterations # tol - convergence tolerance optim_gd &lt;- function(par, fn, gr, eta=0.01, maxit=1000, tol=1e-8) { f_last &lt;- fn(par) for (i in 1:maxit) { par &lt;- par - eta*grad_g_vectorised(par) # update step f_cur &lt;- fn(par) if (abs(f_cur-f_last) &lt; tol) break f_last &lt;- f_cur } list( # see ?optim, section `Value` par=par, value=g_vectorised(par), counts=i, convergence=as.integer(i==maxit) ) } Tests of the \\(g\\) function: eta &lt;- 0.01 optim_gd(c(-3,1), g_vectorised, grad_g_vectorised, eta=eta) ## $par ## [1] -1.542291 2.156410 ## ## $value ## [1] 1.332582e-08 ## ## $counts ## [1] 135 ## ## $convergence ## [1] 0 Zooming in the contour plot to see the actual path (\\(\\eta=0.01\\)): ## List of 4 ## $ par : num [1:2] -1.54 2.16 ## $ value : num 1.33e-08 ## $ counts : int 135 ## $ convergence: int 0 Now with \\(\\eta=0.05\\): ## List of 4 ## $ par : num [1:2] -1.54 2.15 ## $ value : num 0.000203 ## $ counts : int 417 ## $ convergence: int 0 And now with \\(\\eta=0.1\\): ## List of 4 ## $ par : num [1:2] -1.52 2.33 ## $ value : num 0.507 ## $ counts : int 1000 ## $ convergence: int 1 If the learning rate \\(\\eta\\) is too small, the convergence might be too slow and we might get stuck in a plateau. On the other hand, if \\(\\eta\\) is too large, we might be overshooting and end up bouncing around the minimum.   This is why many optimisation libraries (including keras/TensorFlow) implement some of the following ideas: learning rate decay – start with large \\(\\eta\\), decreasing it in every iteration, say, by some percent; line search – determine optimal \\(\\eta\\) in every step by solving a 1-dimensional optimisation problem w.r.t. \\(\\eta\\in[0,\\eta_{\\max}]\\); momentum – the update step is based on a combination of the gradient direction and the previous change of the parameters, \\(\\Delta\\mathbf{x}\\); can be used too accelerate search in the relevant direction and minimise oscillations. 6.3.4 Example: MNIST Recall that in the previous chapter we’ve studied the MNIST dataset. Let us go back to the task of fitting a multiclass logistic regression model. library(&quot;keras&quot;) mnist &lt;- dataset_mnist() # get train/test images in greyscale X_train &lt;- mnist$train$x/255 # to [0,1] X_test &lt;- mnist$test$x/255 # to [0,1] # get the corresponding labels in {0,1,...,9}: Y_train &lt;- mnist$train$y Y_test &lt;- mnist$test$y The labels need to be one-hot encoded: one_hot_encode &lt;- function(Y) { stopifnot(is.numeric(Y)) c1 &lt;- min(Y) # first class label cK &lt;- max(Y) # last class label K &lt;- cK-c1+1 # number of classes Y2 &lt;- matrix(0, nrow=length(Y), ncol=K) Y2[cbind(1:length(Y), Y-c1+1)] &lt;- 1 Y2 } Y_train2 &lt;- one_hot_encode(Y_train) Y_test2 &lt;- one_hot_encode(Y_test) Recall that the output of the logistic regression model (1-layer neural network with softmax) can be written in the matrix form as: \\[ \\hat{\\mathbf{Y}}=\\mathrm{softmax}\\left( \\mathbf{\\dot{X}}\\,\\mathbf{B} \\right), \\] where \\(\\mathbf{\\dot{X}}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times 785}\\) is a matrix representing \\(n\\) images of size \\(28\\times 28\\), augmented with a column of \\(1\\)s, and \\(\\mathbf{B}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{785\\times 10}\\) is the coefficients matrix and \\(\\mathrm{softmax}\\) is applied on each matrix row separately. Of course, by the definition of matrix multiplication, \\(\\hat{\\mathbf{Y}}\\) will be a matrix of size \\(n\\times 10\\), where \\(\\hat{y}_{i,k}\\) represents the predicted probability that the \\(i\\)-th image depicts the \\(k\\)-th digit. # convert to matrices of size n*784 # and add a column of 1s X_train1 &lt;- cbind(1.0, matrix(X_train, ncol=28*28)) X_test1 &lt;- cbind(1.0, matrix(X_test, ncol=28*28)) softmax &lt;- function(T) { T &lt;- exp(T) T/rowSums(T) } nn_predict &lt;- function(B, X) { softmax(X %*% B) } Define the functions to compute cross-entropy (which we shall minimise) and accuracy (which we shall report to a user): accuracy &lt;- function(Y_true, Y_pred) { # both arguments are one-hot encoded Y_true_decoded &lt;- apply(Y_true, 1, which.max) Y_pred_decoded &lt;- apply(Y_pred, 1, which.max) # proportion of equal corresponding pairs: mean(Y_true_decoded == Y_pred_decoded) } cross_entropy &lt;- function(Y_true, Y_pred) { -sum(Y_true*log(Y_pred))/nrow(Y_true) } (*) Cross-entropy in non-matrix form (\\(n\\) – number of samples, \\(K\\) – number of classes, \\(p+1\\) – number of model parameters; in our case \\(K=10\\) and \\(p=784\\)): \\[ \\begin{array}{rcl} E(\\mathbf{B}) &amp;=&amp; -\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{n} \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n \\displaystyle\\sum_{k=1}^K y_{i,k} \\log\\left( \\frac{ \\exp\\left( \\displaystyle\\sum_{j=0}^p \\dot{x}_{i,j} \\beta_{j,k} \\right) }{ \\displaystyle\\sum_{c=1}^K \\exp\\left( \\displaystyle\\sum_{j=0}^p \\dot{x}_{i,j} \\beta_{j,c} \\right) } \\right)\\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\displaystyle\\frac{1}{n} \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left( \\log \\left(\\displaystyle\\sum_{k=1}^K \\exp\\left( \\displaystyle\\sum_{j=0}^p \\dot{x}_{i,j} \\beta_{j,k} \\right)\\right) - \\displaystyle\\sum_{k=1}^K y_{i,k} \\displaystyle\\sum_{j=0}^p \\dot{x}_{i,j} \\beta_{j,k} \\right) \\end{array} \\] (***) Partial derivative of cross-entropy w.r.t. \\(\\beta_{a,b}\\) in non-matrix form: \\[ \\begin{array}{rcl} \\displaystyle\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial \\beta_{a,b}}(\\mathbf{B}) &amp;=&amp; \\displaystyle\\frac{1}{n} \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n \\dot{x}_{i,a} \\left( \\frac{ \\exp\\left( \\displaystyle\\sum_{j=0}^p \\dot{x}_{i,j} \\beta_{j,b} \\right) }{ \\displaystyle\\sum_{k=1}^K \\exp\\left( \\displaystyle\\sum_{j=0}^p \\dot{x}_{i,j} \\beta_{j,k} \\right) } - y_{i,b} \\right)\\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\displaystyle\\frac{1}{n} \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n \\dot{x}_{i,a} \\left( \\hat{y}_{i,b} - y_{i,b} \\right) \\end{array} \\] It may be shown (*) that the gradient of cross-entropy (with respect to the parameter matrix \\(\\mathbf{B}\\)) can be expressed in the matrix form as: \\[ \\frac{1}{n} \\mathbf{\\dot{X}}^T\\, (\\mathbf{\\hat{Y}}-\\mathbf{Y}) \\] grad_cross_entropy &lt;- function(X, Y_true, Y_pred) { t(X) %*% (Y_pred-Y_true)/nrow(Y_true) } Luckily, we are not overwhelmed with the above, because we can always substitute the gradient with the finite differences (yet, these will be slower). :) Let us implement the gradient descent method: # random matrix of size 785x10 - initial guess B &lt;- matrix(rnorm(ncol(X_train1)*ncol(Y_train2)), nrow=ncol(X_train1)) eta &lt;- 0.1 # learning rate maxit &lt;- 100 # number of GD iterations system.time({ # measure time spent # for simplicity, we stop only when we reach maxit for (i in 1:maxit) { B &lt;- B - eta*grad_cross_entropy( X_train1, Y_train2, nn_predict(B, X_train1)) } }) # `user` - processing time in seconds: ## user system elapsed ## 80.983 26.926 40.358 Unfortunately, the method’s convergence is really slow (we are optimising over \\(7850\\) parameters…) and the results after 100 iterations are disappointing: accuracy(Y_train2, nn_predict(B, X_train1)) ## [1] 0.4646167 accuracy(Y_test2, nn_predict(B, X_test1)) ## [1] 0.4735 6.3.5 Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) In turns out that there’s a simple cure for that. Sometimes the true global minimum of cross-entropy for the whole training set is not exactly what we really want. In our predictive modelling task, we are minimising train error but what we really want is to minimise the test error [which we cannot refer to while training = no cheating!] It is rational to assume that both the train and the test set consist of random digits independently sampled from the set of “all the possible digits out there in the world”. Looking at the objective (cross-entropy): \\[ E(\\mathbf{B}) = -\\frac{1}{n^\\text{train}} \\sum_{i=1}^{n^\\text{train}} \\log \\Pr(Y=y_i^\\text{train}|\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot}^\\text{train},\\mathbf{B}). \\] How about we try fitting to different random samples of the train set in each iteration of the gradient descent method instead of fitting to the whole train set? \\[ E(\\mathbf{B}) = -\\frac{1}{b} \\sum_{i=1}^b \\log \\Pr(Y=y_{\\text{random\\_index}_i}^\\text{train}|\\mathbf{x}_{\\text{random\\_index}_i,\\cdot}^\\text{train},\\mathbf{B}), \\] where \\(b\\) is some fixed batch size. Such a scheme is often called stochastic gradient descent. Technically, this is sometimes referred to as mini-batch gradient descent; there are a few variations popular in the literature, we pick the most intuitive now. Stochastic gradient descent: B &lt;- matrix(rnorm(ncol(X_train1)*ncol(Y_train2)), nrow=ncol(X_train1)) eta &lt;- 0.1 maxit &lt;- 100 batch_size &lt;- 32 system.time({ for (i in 1:maxit) { wh &lt;- sample(nrow(X_train1), size=batch_size) B &lt;- B - eta*grad_cross_entropy( X_train1[wh,], Y_train2[wh,], nn_predict(B, X_train1[wh,]) ) } }) ## user system elapsed ## 0.141 0.071 0.085 accuracy(Y_train2, nn_predict(B, X_train1)) ## [1] 0.40435 accuracy(Y_test2, nn_predict(B, X_test1)) ## [1] 0.4123 The errors are slightly worse but that was very quick.

["outro-5.html", "6.4 Outro", " 6.4 Outro 6.4.1 Remarks Solving continuous problems with many variables (e.g., deep neural networks) is time consuming – the more variables to optimise over (e.g., model parameters, think the number of interconnections between all the neurons), the slower the optimisation process. (*) Good luck fitting a logistic regression model to MNIST with optim()’s BFGS – there are 7850 variables. Training deep neural networks with SGD is slow too, but there is a trick to propagate weight updates layer by layer, called backpropagation (actually used in every neural network library), see, e.g., (Goodfellow et al. 2016).   With methods such as GD or SGD, there is no guarantee we reach a minimum, but an approximate solution is better than no solution at all. Also sometimes (especially in ML applications) we don’t really need the actual minimum (with respect to the train set). 6.4.2 Optimisers in Keras Keras implements various optimisers that we can refer to in the compile() function, see https://keras.rstudio.com/reference/compile.html and https://keras.io/optimizers/ SGD – stochastic gradient descent supporting momentum and learning rate decay, RMSprop – divides the gradient by a running average of its recent magnitude, Adam – adaptive momentum and so on. These are all fancy variations of the pure stochastic GD. Some of them are just tricks that work well in some examples and destroy the convergence on other ones. You will get into their details in a dedicated course covering deep neural networks in more detail (see, e.g., (Goodfellow et al. 2016)), but you already have developed some good intuitions! 6.4.3 Note on Search Spaces Most often, the choice of the search space \\(D\\) in an continuous optimisation problem can be: \\(D=\\mathbb{R}^p\\) – continuous unconstrained (typical in ML) \\(D=[a_1,b_1]\\times\\dots\\times[a_n,b_n]\\) – continuous with box constraints see method=\"L-BFGS-B\" in optim() constrained with \\(k\\) linear inequality constraints \\(a_{1,1} x_1 + \\dots + a_{1,p} x_p \\le b_1\\), …, \\(a_{k,1} x_1 + \\dots + a_{k,p} x_p \\le b_k\\) (*) supported in linear and quadratic programming solvers, where the objective function is from a very specific class 6.4.4 Further Reading Recommended further reading: (Nocedal &amp; Wright 2006) (Fletcher 2008) "],

["unsupervised-learning.html", "7.1 Unsupervised Learning", " 7.1 Unsupervised Learning 7.1.1 Introduction In unsupervised learning (learning without a teacher), the input data points \\(\\mathbf{x}_{1,\\cdot},\\dots,\\mathbf{x}_{n,\\cdot}\\) are not assigned any reference labels. Our aim now is to discover the underlying structure in the data. 7.1.2 Main Types of Unsupervised Learning Problems In dimensionality reduction we seek a meaningful projection of a high dimensional space (think: many variables/columns). This might enable us to plot high-dimensional data or understand its structure better. Example methods: Multidimensional scaling (MDS) Principal component analysis (PCA) Kernel PCA t-SNE Autoencoders (deep learning) In anomaly detection, out task is to identify rare, suspicious, ab-normal or out-standing items. For example, these can be cars on walkways in a park’s security camera footage. The aim of clustering is to automatically discover some naturally occurring subgroups in the data set. For example, these may be customers having different shopping patterns (such as “young parents”, “students”, “boomers”). 7.1.3 Clustering More formally, given \\(K\\ge 2\\), clustering aims is to find a special kind of a \\(K\\)-partition of the input data set \\(\\mathbf{X}\\). \\(\\mathcal{C}=\\{C_1,\\dots,C_K\\}\\) is a \\(K\\)-partition of \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) of size \\(n\\), whenever: \\(C_k\\neq\\emptyset\\) for all \\(k\\) (each set is nonempty), \\(C_k\\cap C_l=\\emptyset\\) for all \\(k\\neq l\\) (sets are pairwise disjoint), \\(\\bigcup_{k=1}^K C_k=\\{1,\\dots,n\\}\\) (no point is neglected). This can also be thought of as assigning each point a unique label \\(\\{1,\\dots,K\\}\\) (think: colouring of the points, where each number has a colour). “\\(\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot}\\) is labelled \\(j\\) iff it belongs to cluster \\(C_j\\), i.e., \\(i\\in C_j\\)”. Example applications of clustering: taxonomization: e.g., partition the consumers to more “uniform” groups to better understand who they are and what do they need, image processing: e.g., object detection, like tumour tissues on medical images, complex networks analysis: e.g., detecting communities in friendship, retweets and other networks, fine-tuning supervised learning algorithms: e.g., recommender systems indicating content that was rated highly by users from the same group or learning multiple manifolds in a dimension reduction task. The number of possible \\(K\\)-partitions of a set with \\(n\\) elements is given by the Stirling number of the second kind: \\[ \\left\\{{n \\atop K}\\right\\}={\\frac {1}{K!}}\\sum _{{j=0}}^{{K}}(-1)^{{K-j}}{\\binom {K}{j}}j^{n}; \\] e.g., already \\(\\left\\{{n \\atop 2}\\right\\}=2^{n-1}-1\\) and \\(\\left\\{{n \\atop 3}\\right\\}=O(3^n)\\) – that is a lot. Certainly, we are not just interested in “any” partition. However, even one of the most famous textbooks provides us with only a vague hint: Clustering concerns “segmenting a collection of objects into subsets so that those within each cluster are more closely related to one another than objects assigned to different clusters” (Hastie et al. 2017). There are two main types of clustering algorithms: parametric (model-based): find clusters of specific shapes, or following specific multidimensional probability distributions, e.g., \\(K\\)-means, expectation-maximization for Gaussian mixtures (EM), average linkage agglomerative clustering; nonparametric (model-free): identify high-density or well-separable regions, perhaps in the presence of noise points, e.g., single linkage agglomerative clustering, Genie, (H)DBSCAN, BIRCH. In this chapter we’ll take a look at two clustering approaches: K-means clustering that looks for a specific number of clusters (agglomerative) hierarchical clustering that outputs a whole hierarchy of nested data partitions "],

In the \\(K\\)-means clustering, we wish to find \\(\\boldsymbol\\mu_{1,\\cdot}, \\dots, \\boldsymbol\\mu_{K,\\cdot}\\) that minimise the total within-cluster distances (distances from each point to each own cluster centre): \\[ \\min_{\\boldsymbol\\mu_{1,\\cdot}, \\dots, \\boldsymbol\\mu_{K,\\cdot} \\in \\mathbb{R}^p} \\sum_{i=1}^n d(\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot}, \\boldsymbol\\mu_{C(i),\\cdot}), \\] Note that the \\(\\boldsymbol\\mu\\)s are also “hidden” inside the point-to-cluster belongingness mapping, \\(\\mathrm{C}\\). Expanding the above yields: \\[ \\min_{\\boldsymbol\\mu_{1,\\cdot}, \\dots, \\boldsymbol\\mu_{K,\\cdot} \\in \\mathbb{R}^p} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left( \\min_{k=1,\\dots,K} \\sum_{j=1}^p \\left(x_{i,j}-\\mu_{k,j}\\right)^2 \\right). \\] Unfortunately, the \\(\\min\\) operator in the objective function makes this optimisation problem not tractable with the methods discussed in the previous chapter. The above problem is hard to solve. (*) More precisely, it is an NP-hard problem. Therefore, in practice we use various heuristics to solve it. kmeans() in R implements the Hartigan-Wong, Lloyd, Forgy and MacQueen algorithms. (*) Technically, there is no such thing as “the K-means algorithm” – all the above are particular heuristic approaches to solving the K-means clustering problem as specified by the aforementioned optimisation task. By setting nstart = 10 above, we ask the (Hartigan-Wong) algorithm to find 10 solution candidates obtained by considering different random initial clusterings and choose the best one (with respect to the sum of within-cluster distance) amongst them. This does not guarantee finding the optimal solution, especially in high-dimensional spaces, but increases the likelihood of such. Lloyd’s algorithm (1957) is sometimes referred to as “the” K-means algorithm: Start with random cluster centres \\(\\boldsymbol\\mu_{1,\\cdot}, \\dots, \\boldsymbol\\mu_{K,\\cdot}\\). For each point \\(\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot}\\), determine its closest centre \\(C(i)\\in\\{1,\\dots,K\\}\\). For each cluster \\(k\\in\\{1,\\dots,K\\}\\), compute the new cluster centre \\(\\boldsymbol\\mu_{k,\\cdot}\\) as the componentwise arithmetic mean of the coordinates of all the point indices \\(i\\) such that \\(C(i)=k\\). If the cluster centres changed since last iteration, go to step 2, otherwise stop and return the result.

["hierarchical-methods.html", "7.3 Hierarchical Methods", " 7.3 Hierarchical Methods 7.3.1 Introduction In K-means, we need to specify the number of clusters, \\(K\\), in advance. What if we don’t know it? There is no guarantee that a \\((K+1)\\)-partition is “similar” to the \\(K\\)-one. Hierarchical methods, on the other hand, output a whole hierarchy of mutually nested partitions, which increase the interpretability of the results. A \\(K\\)-partition for any \\(K\\) can be extracted later. Here we are interested in agglomerative algorithms. At the lowest level of the hierarchy, each point belongs to its own cluster (there are \\(n\\) singletons). At the highest level of the hierarchy, there is one cluster containing all the points. Moving from the \\(i\\)-th to the \\((i+1)\\)-th level, we select a pair of clusters to be merged. 7.3.2 Example in R # Distances between all pairs of points: D &lt;- dist(X) # Apply Complete Linkage (the default, see below): h &lt;- hclust(D) # method=&quot;complete&quot; print(h) ## ## Call: ## hclust(d = D) ## ## Cluster method : complete ## Distance : euclidean ## Number of objects: 150 cutree(h, k=3) # extract the 3-partition ## [1] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ## [30] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ## [59] 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ## [88] 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 2 3 3 3 3 2 3 3 3 2 3 3 2 2 2 ## [117] 3 3 3 2 3 2 3 2 3 3 2 2 3 3 3 3 3 2 3 3 3 3 2 3 3 2 2 3 3 ## [146] 2 2 2 3 2 Different cuts of the hierarchy: A dendrogram depicts the distances (* as defined by the linkage function) between the clusters merged at every stage.

While a hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm is being computed, there are \\(n-k\\) clusters at the \\(k\\)-th step of the procedure, \\(\\mathcal{C}^{(k)}=\\{C_1^{(k)},\\dots,C_{n-k}^{(k)}\\}\\). When proceeding from step \\(k\\) to \\(k+1\\), we determine \\(C_u^{(k)}\\) and \\(C_v^{(k)}\\), \\(u&lt;v\\), to be merged together so that we get: \\[ \\mathcal{C}^{(k+1)} = \\left\\{ C_1^{(k)},\\dots,C_{u-1}^{(k)}, C_u^{(k)}{\\cup C_v^{(k)}}, C_{u+1}^{(k)},\\dots,C_{v-1}^{(k)}, C_{v+1}^{(k)},\\dots,C_{n-k}^{(k)} \\right\\}. \\] Thus, \\((\\mathcal{C}^{(0)}, \\mathcal{C}^{(1)}, \\dots, \\mathcal{C}^{(n-1)})\\) is a sequence of nested partitions of \\(\\{1,2,\\dots,n\\}\\) with \\(\\mathcal{C}^{(n-1)}=\\left\\{ \\{1,2,\\dots,n\\} \\right\\}\\). 7.3.4 Linkage Functions A pair of clusters \\(C_u^{(k)}\\) and \\(C_v^{(k)}\\) to be merged with each other is determined by: \\[ \\mathrm{arg}\\min_{u &lt; v} d^*(C_u^{(k)}, C_v^{(k)}), \\] where \\(d^*(A,B)\\) is the distance between two clusters \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). Note that we usually only consider the distances between single points, not sets of points. \\(d^*\\) is a suitable extension of a pointwise distance \\(d\\) (usually the Euclidean metric) to whole sets. We will assume that \\(d^*(\\{\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot}\\},\\{\\mathbf{x}_{j,\\cdot}\\})= d(\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot},\\mathbf{x}_{j,\\cdot})\\), i.e., the distance between singleton clusters is the same as the distance between the points themselves. There are many popular choices of \\(d^*\\) (which in the context of hierarchical clustering we call a linkage function) Single linkage: \\[ d_S^*(A,B) = \\min_{\\mathbf{a}\\in A, \\mathbf{b}\\in B} d(\\mathbf{a},\\mathbf{b}) \\] Complete linkage: \\[ d_C^*(A,B) = \\max_{\\mathbf{a}\\in A, \\mathbf{b}\\in B} d(\\mathbf{a},\\mathbf{b}) \\] Average linkage: \\[ d_A^*(A,B) = \\frac{1}{|A| |B|} \\sum_{\\mathbf{a}\\in A}\\sum_{\\mathbf{b}\\in B} d(\\mathbf{a},\\mathbf{b}) \\] Computing linkages – an illustration: Complete linkage (again): Average linkage: Single linkage (this is a typical behaviour!): "],
["outro-6.html", "7.4 Outro", " 7.4 Outro 7.4.1 Remarks The aim of K-means is to find \\(K\\) clusters based on the notion of the points’ closeness to the cluster centres. Remember that \\(K\\) must be set in advance. By definition (* via its relation to Voronoi diagrams), all clusters will be of convex shapes. However, we may try applying \\(K&#39;\\)-means for \\(K&#39; \\gg K\\) to obtained a “fine grained” data compression and then combine the (sub)clusters into more meaningful groups using other methods. Iterative K-means algorithms are very fast even for large data sets, but they may fail to find a desirable solution, see the next chapter for discussion. On the other hand, hierarchical methods output a whole family of mutually nested partitions, which may provide us with insight into the underlying data structure. Unfortunately, there is no easy way to assign new points to existing clusters. Linkage scheme must be chosen with care. These are generally slow – \\(O(n^2)\\) to \\(O(n^3)\\) complexity. Note that the fastcluster package provides a more efficient implementation of some methods available via a call to hclust(). See also the genie package for a robust algorithm based on the minimum spanning tree, which can be computed quickly. Unsupervised learning is often performed during the data pre-processing and exploration stage. Assessing the quality of clustering is particularly challenging as, unlike in a supervised setting, we have no access to “ground truth” information. Moreover, some unsupervised methods do not easily generalise to unobserved data. Also many clustering methods are based on the notion of pairwise distances but these tend to behave weirdly in high-dimensional spaces (“the curse of dimensionality”). However, clustering methods can aid with supervised tasks – instead of fitting a single “large model”, it might be useful to fit separate models to each cluster. 7.4.2 Other Noteworthy Clustering Algorithms Other noteworthy clustering approaches: Genie (see R package genie) (Gagolewski et al. 2016, Cena &amp; Gagolewski 2020) ITM (Müller et al. 2012) DBSCAN, HDBSCAN* (Ling 1973, Ester et al. 1996, Campello et al. 2015) K-medoids, K-medians Fuzzy C-means (a.k.a. weighted K-means) (Bezdek et al. 1984) Spectral clustering; e.g., (Ng et al. 2001) BIRCH (Zhang et al. 1996) 7.4.3 Further Reading Recommended further reading: (James et al. 2017: Section 10.3) Other: (Hastie et al. 2017: Section 14.3) "],

["introduction-14.html", "8.1 Introduction", " 8.1 Introduction 8.1.1 Recap Recall that an optimisation task deals with finding an element \\({x}\\) in a search space \\(D\\), that minimises or maximises an objective function \\(f:D\\to\\mathbb{R}\\): \\[ \\min_{{x}\\in D} f({x}) \\quad\\text{or}\\quad\\max_{{x}\\in D} f({x}), \\] In one of the previous chapters, we were dealing with unconstrained continuous optimisation, i.e., we assumed the search space is \\(D=\\mathbb{R}^p\\) for some \\(p\\).   Example problems of this kind: minimising mean squared error in linear regression or cross-entropy in logistic regression. The class of general-purpose iterative algorithms we’ve previously studied fit into the following scheme: \\(\\mathbf{x}^{(0)}\\) – initial guess (e.g., generated at random) for \\(i=1,...,M\\): \\(\\mathbf{x}^{(i)} = \\mathbf{x}^{(i-1)}+\\text{[guessed direction, e.g.,}-\\eta\\nabla f(\\mathbf{x})\\text{]}\\) if \\(|f(\\mathbf{x}^{(i)})-f(\\mathbf{x}^{(i-1)})| &lt; \\varepsilon\\) break return \\(\\mathbf{x}^{(i)}\\) as result where: \\(M\\) = maximum number of iterations \\(\\varepsilon\\) = tolerance, e.g, \\(10^{-8}\\) \\(\\eta&gt;0\\) = learning rate The algorithms such as gradient descent and BFGS (see optim()) give satisfactory results in the case of smooth and well-behaving objective functions. However, if an objective has, e.g., many plateaus (regions where it is almost constant), those methods might easily get stuck in local minima. The K-means clustering’s objective function is a not particularly pleasant one – it involves a nested search for the closest cluster, with the use of the \\(\\min\\) operator. 8.1.2 K-means Revisited In K-means clustering we are minimising the squared Euclidean distance to each point’s cluster centre: \\[ \\min_{\\boldsymbol\\mu_{1,\\cdot}, \\dots, \\boldsymbol\\mu_{K,\\cdot} \\in \\mathbb{R}^p} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left( \\min_{k=1,\\dots,K} \\sum_{j=1}^p \\left(x_{i,j}-\\mu_{k,j}\\right)^2 \\right). \\] This is an (NP-)hard problem! There is no efficient exact algorithm. We need approximations. In the last chapter, we have discussed the iterative Lloyd’s algorithm (1957), which is amongst a few procedures implemented in the kmeans() function. To recall, Lloyd’s algorithm (1957) is sometimes referred to as “the” K-means algorithm: Start with random cluster centres \\(\\boldsymbol\\mu_{1,\\cdot}, \\dots, \\boldsymbol\\mu_{K,\\cdot}\\). For each point \\(\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot}\\), determine its closest centre \\(C(i)\\in\\{1,\\dots,K\\}\\). For each cluster \\(k\\in\\{1,\\dots,K\\}\\), compute the new cluster centre \\(\\boldsymbol\\mu_{k,\\cdot}\\) as the componentwise arithmetic mean of the coordinates of all the point indices \\(i\\) such that \\(C(i)=k\\). If the cluster centres changed since last iteration, go to step 2, otherwise stop and return the result.   As the procedure might get stuck in a local minimum, a few restarts are recommended (as usual). Hence, we are used to calling: kmeans(X, centers=k, nstart=10) 8.1.3 optim() vs. kmeans() Let us compare how a general-purpose optimiser such as the BFGS algorithm implemented in optim() compares with a customised, problem-specific solver. We will need some benchmark data. gen_cluster &lt;- function(n, p, m, s) { vectors &lt;- matrix(rnorm(n*p), nrow=n, ncol=p) unit_vectors &lt;- vectors/sqrt(rowSums(vectors^2)) unit_vectors*rnorm(n, 0, s)+rep(m, each=n) } The above function generates \\(n\\) points in \\(\\mathbb{R}^p\\) from a distribution centred at \\(\\mathbf{m}\\in\\mathbb{R}^p\\), spread randomly in every possible direction with scale factor \\(s\\).

["a-note-on-convex-optimisation.html", "8.2 A Note on Convex Optimisation (*)", " 8.2 A Note on Convex Optimisation (*) 8.2.1 Introduction Are there cases where we are sure that a local minimum is the global minimum? Yes. For example when we minimise convex objective functions. Here is just a very brief overview of the topic for the interested, see also (Boyd &amp; Vandenberghe 2004) for more. For example, the linear regression or the logistic regression have convex objectives – they are very well-behaving. Note that this doesn’t mean that we know an analytic solution. 8.2.2 Convex Combinations (*) A convex combination of a set of points \\(x_1,\\dots,x_n\\in D\\) is a linear combination \\[ \\theta_1 x_1 + \\theta_2 x_2 + \\dots + \\theta_n x_n \\] for some \\(\\theta_1,\\theta_2,\\dots,\\theta_n\\) that fulfils \\(\\theta_1,\\theta_2,\\dots,\\theta_n\\ge 0\\) and \\(\\theta_1+\\theta_2+\\dots+\\theta_n=1\\). Think of this as a weighted arithmetic mean of these points. The set of all convex combinations of two points \\(x_1,x_2\\in D\\): \\[\\{\\theta x_{1}+(1-\\theta)x_{2}: \\theta\\in [0,1]\\}\\] is just the line segment between these two points. The set of all convex combinations of 3 points yields a triangle (unless \\(D\\) is one-dimensional). More generally, we get the convex hull of a set of points – the smallest set \\(C\\) enclosing all the points that is convex, i.e., a line segment between any two points in \\(C\\) is fully included in \\(C\\). In two dimensions, think of a rubber band stretched around all the points like a fence. 8.2.3 Convex Functions (*) We call a function \\(f:D\\to\\mathbb{R}\\) convex, whenever: \\[ (\\forall x_{1},x_{2}\\in D) (\\forall \\theta\\in [0,1])\\quad f(\\theta x_{1}+(1-\\theta)x_{2})\\leq \\theta f(x_{1})+(1-\\theta)f(x_{2}) \\] (function value at any convex combination of two points is not greater than that combination of the function values at these two points) Convex: \\(f(\\theta x_{1}+(1-\\theta)x_{2})\\leq \\theta f(x_{1})+(1-\\theta)f(x_{2})\\) Concave: \\(f(\\theta x_{1}+(1-\\theta)x_{2})\\geq \\theta f(x_{1})+(1-\\theta)f(x_{2})\\) Theorem For any convex function \\(f\\), if \\(f\\) has a local minimum at \\(x\\) then \\(x\\) is also its global minimum. Optimising convex functions is relatively easy, especially if they are differentiable. Methods such as gradient descent or BFGS should work very well (unless there are large regions where a function is constant…).   (**) There is a special class of constrained optimisation problems called linear and quadratic programming that involves convex functions, see (Nocedal &amp; Wright 2006, Fletcher 2008).

["genetic-algorithms.html", "8.3 Genetic Algorithms", " 8.3 Genetic Algorithms 8.3.1 Introduction What if our optimisation problem cannot be solved reliably with gradient-based methods like those in optim() and we don’t have any custom solver for the task at hand? There are a couple of useful metaheuristics in the literature that can serve this purpose. Most of them rely on clever randomised search. They are slow to run and don’t guarantee anything, but yet they still might be useful – better a solution than no solution at all. There is a wide class of nature-inspired algorithms (that traditionally belong to the subfield of AI called computational intelligence or soft computing); see, e.g, (Simon 2013): evolutionary algorithms – inspired by the principle of natural selection maintain a population of candidate solutions, let the “fittest” combine with each other to generate new “offspring” solutions. swarm algorithms maintain a herd of candidate solutions, allow them to “explore” the environment, “communicate” with each other in order to seek the best spot to “go to”. For example: ant colony bees cuckoo search particle sward krill herd other metaheuristics: harmony search memetic algorithm firefly algorithm All of these sound fancy, but the general ideas behind them are pretty simple. 8.3.2 Overview of the Method Genetic algorithms (GAs) are amongst the most popular evolutionary approaches. They are based on Charles Darwin’s work on evolution by natural selection. See (Goldberg, 1989) for a comprehensive overview and (Simon, 2013) for extensions. Here is the general idea of a GA (there might be many) to minimise a given objective/fitness function \\(f\\) over a given domain \\(D\\). Generate a random initial population of individuals – \\(n_\\text{pop}\\) points in \\(D\\), e.g., \\(n_\\text{pop}=128\\) Repeat until some convergence criterion is not met: evaluate the fitness of each individual select the pairs of the individuals for reproduction, the fitter should be selected more eagerly apply crossover operations to create offspring slightly mutate randomly selected individuals replace the old population with the new one 8.3.3 Example Implementation - GA for K-means Initial setup: set.seed(123) # simulation parameters: npop &lt;- 32 niter &lt;- 100 # randomly generate an initial population of size `npop`: pop &lt;- lapply(1:npop, function(i) X[sample(nrow(X), K),]) # evaluate fitness of each individual: cur_fitness &lt;- sapply(pop, get_fitness, X) cur_best_fitness &lt;- min(cur_fitness) best_fitness &lt;- cur_best_fitness Each individual in the population is just the set of \\(K\\) candidate cluster centres represented as a matrix in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{K\\times p}\\). Let’s assume that the fitness of each individual should be a function of the rank of the objective function’s value (smallest objective == highest rank == best fit). For the crossover, we will sample pairs of individuals with probabilities proportional to their fitness. selection &lt;- function(cur_fitness) { npop &lt;- length(cur_fitness) probs &lt;- rank(-cur_fitness) probs &lt;- probs/sum(probs) left &lt;- sample(npop, npop, replace=TRUE, prob=probs) right &lt;- sample(npop, npop, replace=TRUE, prob=probs) cbind(left, right) } An example crossover combines each cluster centre in such a way that we take a few coordinates of the “left” parent and the remaining ones from the “right” parent (see below for an illustration): crossover &lt;- function(pop, pairs, K, p) { old_pop &lt;- pop pop &lt;- pop[pairs[,2]] for (j in 1:length(pop)) { wh &lt;- sample(p-1, K, replace=TRUE) for (l in 1:K) pop[[j]][l,1:wh[l]] &lt;- old_pop[[pairs[j,1]]][l,1:wh[l]] } pop } Mutation (occurring with a very small probability) substitutes some cluster centre with a random vector from the input dataset. mutate &lt;- function(pop, X, K) { for (j in 1:length(pop)) { if (runif(1) &lt; 0.025) { szw &lt;- sample(1:K, 1) pop[[j]][szw,] &lt;- X[sample(nrow(X), length(szw)),] } } pop } We also need a function that checks if the new cluster centres aren’t too far away from the input points. If it happens that we have empty clusters, our solution is degenerate and we must correct it. All “bad” cluster centres will be substituted with randomly chosen points from \\(\\mathbf{X}\\). Moreover, we will recompute the cluster centres as the componentwise arithmetic mean of the closest points, just like in Lloyd’s algorithm, to speed up convergence. recompute_mus &lt;- function(pop, X, K) { for (j in 1:length(pop)) { # get nearest cluster centres for each point: memb &lt;- get.knnx(pop[[j]], X, 1)$nn.index sz &lt;- tabulate(memb, K) # number of points in each cluster # if there are empty clusters, fix them: szw &lt;- which(sz==0) if (length(szw)&gt;0) { # random points in X will be new cluster centres pop[[j]][szw,] &lt;- X[sample(nrow(X), length(szw)),] memb &lt;- FNN::get.knnx(pop[[j]], X, 1)$nn.index sz &lt;- tabulate(memb, K) } # recompute cluster centres - componentwise average: pop[[j]][,] &lt;- 0 for (l in 1:nrow(X)) pop[[j]][memb[l],] &lt;- pop[[j]][memb[l],]+X[l,] pop[[j]] &lt;- pop[[j]]/sz } pop } We are ready to build our genetic algorithm to solve the K-means clustering problem: for (i in 1:niter) { pairs &lt;- selection(cur_fitness) pop &lt;- crossover(pop, pairs, K, p) pop &lt;- mutate(pop, X, K) pop &lt;- recompute_mus(pop, X, K) # re-evaluate fitness: cur_fitness &lt;- sapply(pop, get_fitness, X) cur_best_fitness &lt;- min(cur_fitness) # give feedback on what&#39;s going on: if (cur_best_fitness &lt; best_fitness) { best_fitness &lt;- cur_best_fitness best_mu &lt;- pop[[which.min(cur_fitness)]] cat(sprintf(&quot;%5d: f_best=%10.5f\\n&quot;, i, best_fitness)) } } ## 1: f_best=435638.52165 ## 2: f_best=428808.89706 ## 4: f_best=428438.45125 ## 6: f_best=422277.99136 ## 8: f_best=421889.46265 print(get_fitness(best_mu, X)) ## [1] 421889.5 print(get_fitness(res_tried_very_hard, X)) ## [1] 421889.5 It works! :) "],

These optimisation tasks tend to be much harder than the continuous ones. Genetic algorithms might come in handy in such cases. Specialised methods, customised to solve a specific problem (like Lloyd’s algorithm) will often outperform generic ones (like SGD, genetic algorithms) in terms of speed and reliability. All in all, we prefer a suboptimal solution obtained by means of heuristics to no solution at all. Problems that you could try solving with GAs include variable selection in multiple regression – finding the subset of features optimising the AIC (this is a hard problem to and forward selection was just a simple greed heuristic).

["introduction-17.html", "9.1 Introduction", " 9.1 Introduction 9.1.1 What is a Recommender System? A recommender (recommendation) system is a method to predict the rating a user would give to an item. For example: playlist generators at Spotify, YouTube or Netflix, content recommendations on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or Apple News, product recommendations at Amazon or Alibaba. (Ricci et al. 2011) list the following functions of recommender systems: increase the number of items sold, sell more diverse items, increase users’ satisfaction, increase users’ fidelity, better understand what users want. 9.1.2 The Netflix Prize In 2006 Netflix (back then a DVD rental company) released one of the most famous benchmark sets for recommender systems, which helped boost the research on algorithms in this field. See https://www.kaggle.com/netflix-inc/netflix-prize-data; data archived at https://web.archive.org/web/20090925184737/http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Netflix+Prize and https://archive.org/details/nf_prize_dataset.tar The dataset consists of: 480,189 users 17,770 movies 100,480,507 ratings in the training sample: MovieID CustomerID Rating from 1 to 5 Title YearOfRelease from 1890 to 2005 Date of rating in the range 1998-11-01 to 2005-12-31 The quiz set consists of 1,408,342 ratings and it was used by the competitors to assess the quality of their algorithms and compute leaderboard scores. Root mean squared error (RMSE) of predicted vs. true rankings was chosen as a performance metric. The test set of 1,408,789 ratings was used to determine the winner. On 21 Sept. 2009, the grand prize of US$1,000,000 was given to the BellKor’s Pragmatic Chaos team which improved over the Netflix’s Cinematch algorithm by 10.06%, achieving the winning RMSE of 0.8567 on the test subset. 9.1.3 Main Approaches Current recommender systems are quite complex and use a fusion of various approaches, also those based on external knowledge bases. However, we may distinguish at least two core approaches, see (Ricci et al. 2011) for more: Collaborative Filtering It is based on the assumption that if two people interact with the same product, they’re likely to have other interests in common as well. John and Mary both like bananas and apples and dislike spinach. John likes sushi. Mary hasn’t tried sushi yet. It seems they might have similar tastes, so we recommend that Mary should give sushi a try. Content-based Filtering It builds a user’s profile that represent information of what kind of products does she/he like. We have discovered that John likes fruits but dislikes vegetables. An orange is a fruit (an item similar to those he liked in the past) with which John is yet to interact. John should give it a try. Jim Bennett, vice president of recommendations systems at Netflix on the idea behind the original Cinematch algorithm (see https://www.technologyreview.com/s/406637/the-1-million-netflix-challenge/): First, you collect 100 million user ratings for about 18,000 movies. Take any two movies and find the people who have rated both of them. Then look to see if the people who rate one of the movies highly rate the other one highly, if they liked one and not the other, or if they didn’t like either movie. Based on their ratings, Cinematch sees whether there’s a correlation between those people. Now, do this for all possible pairs of 65,000 movies. See also: https://web.archive.org/web/20070821194257/http://www.netflixprize.com/faq Is it an example of collaborative or context-based filtering? 9.1.4 Formalism Let \\(\\mathcal{U}=\\{ U_1,\\dots,U_m \\}\\) denote the set of \\(m\\) users. Let \\(\\mathcal{I}=\\{ I_1,\\dots,I_n \\}\\) denote the set of \\(n\\) items. Let \\(R\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times n}\\) be a user-item matrix such that: \\[ r_{u,i}=\\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} r &amp; \\text{if the $u$-th user ranked the $i$-th item as $r&gt;0$}\\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{if the $u$-th user hasn&#39;t interacted with the $i$-th item yet}\\\\ \\end{array} \\right. \\] Note that here 0 is used to denote a missing value (NA) In particular, we can assume: \\(r_{u,i}\\in\\{0,1,\\dots,5\\}\\) (ratings on the scale 1–5 or no interaction) \\(r_{u,i}\\in\\{0,1\\}\\) (“Like” or no interaction) The aim of an recommender system is to predict the rating \\(\\hat{r}_{u,i}\\) that the \\(u\\)-th user would give to the \\(i\\)-th item provided that currently \\(r_{u,i}=0\\).

["collaborative-filtering.html", "9.2 Collaborative Filtering", " 9.2 Collaborative Filtering 9.2.1 Example In user-based collaborative filtering, we seek users with similar preference profiles/rating patters. “User A has similar behavioural patterns as user B, so we should suggest A what B likes.” In item-based collaborative filtering, we seek items with similar (dis)likeability structure. “Users who (dis)liked X also (dis)liked Y”. .

["outro-8.html", "9.4 Outro", " 9.4 Outro 9.4.1 Remarks Good recommender systems are perfect tools to increase the revenue of any user-centric enterprise. Not a single algorithm, but an ensemble (a proper combination) of different approaches is often used in practice, see the Further Reading section below for the detailed information of the Netflix Prize winners. Recommender systems are an interesting fusion of the techniques we have already studied – linear models, K-nearest neighbours etc. 9.4.2 Issues Building recommender systems is challenging, because data is large yet often sparse; Here is the ratio of available ratings vs. all possible user-item valuations for the Netflix Prize (obviously, it is just a sample of the complete dataset that Netflix has): 100480507/(480189*17770) ## [1] 0.01177558 Sparse matrix (many “zeros” = unassigned ratings) data structure is often used for storing of and computing over such data effectively. Some users are biased in the sense that they are more critical or enthusiastic than average users. Is 3 stars a “bad”, “fair enough” or “good” rating for you? Would you go to a bar/restaurant ranked 3.0 by you favourite Maps app community? It is particularly challenging to predict the preferences of users that cast few ratings, e.g., those who just signed up (the cold start problem). “Hill et al. [1995] have shown that users provide inconsistent ratings when asked to rate the same movie at different times. They suggest that an algorithm cannot be more accurate than the variance in a user’s ratings for the same item.” (Herlocker et al. 2004: p. 6) It is good to take into account the temporal (time-based) characteristics of data as well as external knowledge (e.g., how long ago a rating was cast, what is a film’s genre). The presented approaches are vulnerable to attacks – bots may be used to promote or inhibit selected items. 9.4.3 Further Reading Recommended further reading: (Herlocker et al. 2004) (Ricci et al. 2011) (Lü &amp; others 2012) (Harper &amp; Konstan 2015) Other: (Koren 2009) (Töscher et al. 2009) (Piotte &amp; Chabbert 2009) Also don’t forget to take a look at the R package recommenderlab (amongst others).

["motivation-1.html", "B.1 Motivation", " B.1 Motivation Vector and matrix algebra provides us with a convenient language for expressing computations on sequential and tabular data. Vector and matrix algebra operations are supported by every major programming language – either natively (e.g., R, Matlab, GNU Octave, Mathematica) or via an additional library/package (e.g, Python with numpy, tensorflow or pytorch; C++ with Eigen/Armadillo; C, C++ or Fortran with LAPACK). By using matrix notation, we generate more concise and readable code. For instance, given two vectors \\(\\boldsymbol{x}=(x_1,\\dots,x_n)\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{y}=(y_1,\\dots,y_n)\\) like: x &lt;- c(1.5, 3.5, 2.3,-6.5) y &lt;- c(2.9, 8.2,-0.1, 0.8) Instead of writing: s &lt;- 0 n &lt;- length(x) for (i in 1:n) s &lt;- s + (x[i]-y[i])^2 sqrt(s) ## [1] 9.11592 to mean: \\[ \\sqrt{ (x_1-y_1)^2 + (x_2-y_2)^2 + \\dots + (x_n-y_n)^2 } = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-y_i)^2}, \\] which denotes the (Euclidean) distance between the two vectors (the square root of the sum of squared differences between the corresponding elements in \\(\\boldsymbol{x}\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{y}\\)), we shall soon become used to writing: sqrt(sum((x-y)^2)) ## [1] 9.11592 or: \\[ \\sqrt{(\\boldsymbol{x}-\\boldsymbol{y})^{T}(\\boldsymbol{x}-\\boldsymbol{y})} \\] or even: \\[ \\|\\boldsymbol{x}-\\boldsymbol{y}\\|_2 \\] In order to be able to read this notation, we only have to get to know the most common “building blocks”. There are just a few of them, but it’ll take some time until we become comfortable with their use.

["numeric-vectors.html", "B.2 Numeric Vectors", " B.2 Numeric Vectors B.2.1 Creating Numeric Vectors First let’s introduce a few ways with which we can create numeric vectors. B.2.1.1 c() The c() function combines a given list of values to form a sequence: c(1, 2, 3) ## [1] 1 2 3 c(1, 2, 3, c(4, 5), c(6, c(7, 8))) ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Note that when we use the assignment operator, &lt;- or = (both are equivalent), printing of the output is suppressed: x &lt;- c(1, 2, 3) # doesn&#39;t print anything print(x) ## [1] 1 2 3 However, we can enforce it by parenthesising the whole expression: (x &lt;- c(1, 2, 3)) ## [1] 1 2 3 In order to determine that x is indeed a numeric vector, we call: mode(x) ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; class(x) ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; These two functions might return different results. For instance, in the next chapter we note that a numeric matrix will yield mode() of numeric and class() of matrix. What is more, we can get the number of elements in x by calling: length(x) ## [1] 3 B.2.1.2 seq() To create an arithmetic progression, i.e., a sequence of equally-spaced numbers, we can call the seq() function seq(1, 9, 2) ## [1] 1 3 5 7 9 If we access the function’s documentation (by executing ?seq in the console), we’ll note that the function takes a couple of parameters: from, to, by, length.out etc. The above call is equivalent to: seq(from=1, to=9, by=2) ## [1] 1 3 5 7 9 The by argument can be replaced with length.out, which gives the desired size: seq(0, 1, length.out=5) ## [1] 0.00 0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00 Note that R supports partial matching of argument names: seq(0, 1, len=5) ## [1] 0.00 0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00 Quite often we need progressions with step equal to 1 or -1. Such vectors can be generated by applying the : operator. 1:10 # from:to (inclusive) ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 -1:-10 ## [1] -1 -2 -3 -4 -5 -6 -7 -8 -9 -10 B.2.1.3 rep() Moreover, rep() replicates a given vector.

For instance, the following generates 5 deviates from the uniform distribution (every number has the same probability) on the unit (i.e., \\([0,1]\\)) interval: runif(5, 0, 1) ## [1] 0.5649012 0.5588051 0.4414829 0.2076393 0.6696355 We call such numbers pseudo-random, because they are generated arithmetically. In fact, by setting the random number generator’s state (also called the seed), we can obtain reproducible results. set.seed(123) runif(5, 0, 1) # a,b,c,d,e ## [1] 0.2875775 0.7883051 0.4089769 0.8830174 0.9404673 runif(5, 0, 1) # f,g,h,i,j ## [1] 0.0455565 0.5281055 0.8924190 0.5514350 0.4566147 set.seed(123) runif(5, 0, 1) # a,b,c,d,e again! ## [1] 0.2875775 0.7883051 0.4089769 0.8830174 0.9404673 Note the difference between the uniform distribution on \\([0,1]\\) and the normal distribution with expected value of \\(0\\) and standard deviation of \\(1\\) (also called the standard normal distribution). par(mfrow=c(1, 2)) # align plots in one row and two columns hist(runif(10000, 0, 1), las=1); box() hist(rnorm(10000, 0, 1), las=1); box() Another useful function samples a number of values from a given vector, either with or without replacement: sample(1:10, 8, replace=TRUE) # with replacement ## [1] 3 3 10 2 6 5 4 6 sample(1:10, 8, replace=FALSE) # without replacement ## [1] 9 5 3 8 1 4 6 10 Note that if n is a single number, sample(n, ...) is equivalent to sample(1:n, ...). This is a dangerous behaviour than may lead to bugs in our code. Read more at ?sample. B.2.2 Vector-Scalar Operations Mathematically, we sometimes refer to a vector that is reduced to a single component as a scalar. We are used to denoting such objects with lowercase letters such as \\(a, b, i, s, x\\in\\mathbb{R}\\). Note that some programming languages distinguish between atomic numerical entities and length-one vectors, e.g., 7 vs. [7] in Python. This is not the case in R, where length(7) returns 1. Vector-scalar arithmetic operations such as \\(s\\boldsymbol{x}\\) (multiplication of a vector \\(\\boldsymbol{x}=(x_1,\\dots, x_n)\\) by a scalar \\(s\\)) result in a vector \\(\\boldsymbol{y}\\) such that \\(y_i=s x_i\\), \\(i=1,\\dots,n\\). The same rule holds for, e.g., \\(s+\\boldsymbol{x}\\), \\(\\boldsymbol{x}-s\\), \\(\\boldsymbol{x}/s\\). 0.5 * c(1, 10, 100) ## [1] 0.5 5.0 50.0 10 + 1:5 ## [1] 11 12 13 14 15 seq(0, 10, by=2)/10 ## [1] 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 By \\(-\\boldsymbol{x}\\) we will mean \\((-1)\\boldsymbol{x}\\): -seq(0, 1, length.out=5) ## [1] 0.00 -0.25 -0.50 -0.75 -1.00 Note that in R the same rule applies for exponentiation: (0:5)^2 # synonym: (1:5)**2 ## [1] 0 1 4 9 16 25 2^(0:5) ## [1] 1 2 4 8 16 32 However, in mathematics, we are not used to writing \\(2^{\\boldsymbol{x}}\\) or \\(\\boldsymbol{x}^2\\). B.2.3 Vector-Vector Operations Let \\(\\boldsymbol{x}=(x_1,\\dots,x_n)\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{y}=(y_1,\\dots,y_n)\\) be two vectors of identical lengths. Arithmetic operations \\(\\boldsymbol{x}+\\boldsymbol{y}\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{x}-\\boldsymbol{y}\\) are performed elementwise, i.e., they result in a vector \\(\\boldsymbol{z}\\) such that \\(z_i=x_i+y_i\\) and \\(z_i=x_i-y_i\\), respectively, \\(i=1,\\dots,n\\). x &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4) y &lt;- c(1, 10, 100, 1000) x+y ## [1] 2 12 103 1004 x-y ## [1] 0 -8 -97 -996 Although in mathematics we are not used to using any special notation for elementwise multiplication, division and exponentiation, this is available in R. x*y ## [1] 1 20 300 4000 x/y ## [1] 1.000 0.200 0.030 0.004 y^x ## [1] 1e+00 1e+02 1e+06 1e+12 1e+12 is a number written in the scientific notation. It means “1 times 10 to the power of 12”, i.e., \\(1\\times 10^{12}\\). Physicists love this notation, because they are used to dealing with very small (think sizes of quarks) and very large (think distances between galaxies) entities. Moreover, in R the recycling rule is applied if we perform elementwise operations on vectors of different lengths – the shorter vector is recycled as many times as needed to match the length of the longer vector, just as if we were performing: rep(1:3, length.out=12) # recycle 1,2,3 to get 12 values ## [1] 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 Therefore: 1:6 * c(1) ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 1:6 * c(1,10) ## [1] 1 20 3 40 5 60 1:6 * c(1,10,100) ## [1] 1 20 300 4 50 600 1:6 * c(1,10,100,1000) ## Warning in 1:6 * c(1, 10, 100, 1000): longer object length is ## not a multiple of shorter object length ## [1] 1 20 300 4000 5 60 Note that a warning is not an error – we still get a result that makes sense. B.2.4 Aggregation Functions R implements a couple of aggregation functions: sum(x) = \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i=x_1+x_2+\\dots+x_n\\) prod(x) = \\(\\prod_{i=1}^n x_i=x_1 x_2 \\dots x_n\\) mean(x) = \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\\) – arithmetic mean var(x) = sum((x-mean(x))^2)/(length(x)-1) = \\(\\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(x_i - \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{j=1}^n x_j \\right)^2\\) – variance sd(x) = sqrt(var(x)) – standard deviation see also: min(), max(), median(), quantile(). Remember that you can always access the R manual by typing ?functionname, e.g., ?quantile. Note that \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\\) can also be written as \\(\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\\) or even \\(\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1,\\dots,n} x_i\\). These all mean the sum of \\(x_i\\) for \\(i\\) from \\(1\\) to \\(n\\), that is, the sum of \\(x_1\\), \\(x_2\\), …, \\(x_n\\), i.e., \\(x_1+x_2+\\dots+x_n\\). B.2.5 Special Functions Furthermore, R supports numerous mathematical functions, e.g., sqrt(), abs(), round(), log(), exp(), cos(), sin(). All of them are vectorised – when applied on a vector of length \\(n\\), they yield a vector of length \\(n\\) in result. For example, here is how we can compute the square roots of all the integers between 1 and 9: sqrt(1:9) ## [1] 1.000000 1.414214 1.732051 2.000000 2.236068 2.449490 ## [7] 2.645751 2.828427 3.000000 B.2.6 Norms and Distances Norms are used to measure the size of an object. Mathematically, we will also be interested in the following norms: Euclidean norm: \\[ \\|\\boldsymbol{x}\\| = \\|\\boldsymbol{x}\\|_2 = \\sqrt{ \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 } \\] this is nothing else than the length of the vector \\(\\boldsymbol{x}\\) Manhattan (taxicab) norm: \\[ \\|\\boldsymbol{x}\\|_1 = \\sum_{i=1}^n |x_i| \\] Chebyshev (maximum) norm: \\[ \\|\\boldsymbol{x}\\|_\\infty = \\max_{i=1,\\dots,n} |x_i| = \\max\\{ |x_1|, |x_2|, \\dots, |x_n| \\} \\] The above norms can be easily implemented by means of the building blocks introduced above. This is super easy: z &lt;- c(1, 2) sqrt(sum(z^2)) # or norm(z, &quot;2&quot;); Euclidean ## [1] 2.236068 sum(abs(z)) # Manhattan ## [1] 3 max(abs(z)) # Chebyshev ## [1] 2 Also note that all the norms easily generate the corresponding distances (metrics) between two given points. In particular: \\[ \\| \\boldsymbol{x}-\\boldsymbol{y} \\| = \\sqrt{ \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(x_i-y_i\\right)^2 } \\] gives the Euclidean distance (metric) between the two vectors. u &lt;- c(1, 0) v &lt;- c(1, 1) sqrt(sum((u-v)^2)) ## [1] 1 This is the “normal” distance that you learned at school. B.2.7 Dot Product (*) What is more, given two vectors of identical lengths, \\(\\boldsymbol{x}\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{y}\\), we define their dot product (a.k.a. scalar or inner product) as: \\[ \\boldsymbol{x}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{y} = \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i y_i. \\] Let’s stress that this is not the same as the elementwise vector multiplication in R – the result is a single number. u &lt;- c(1, 0) v &lt;- c(1, 1) sum(u*v) ## [1] 1 (*) Note that the squared Euclidean norm of a vector is equal to the dot product of the vector and itself, \\(\\|\\boldsymbol{x}\\|^2 = \\boldsymbol{x}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{x}\\). (*) Interestingly, a dot product has a nice geometrical interpretation: \\[ \\boldsymbol{x}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{y} = \\|\\boldsymbol{x}\\| \\|\\boldsymbol{y}\\| \\cos\\alpha \\] where \\(\\alpha\\) is the angle between the two vectors. In other words, it is the product of the lengths of the two vectors and the cosine of the angle between them. Note that we can get the cosine part by computing the dot product of the normalised vectors, i.e., such that their lengths are equal to 1. For example, the two vectors u and v defined above can be depicted as: We can compute the angle between them by calling: (len_u &lt;- sqrt(sum(u^2))) # length == Euclidean norm ## [1] 1 (len_v &lt;- sqrt(sum(v^2))) ## [1] 1.414214 (cos_angle_uv &lt;- (sum(u*v)/(len_u*len_v))) # cosine of the angle ## [1] 0.7071068 acos(cos_angle_uv)*180/pi # angle in degs ## [1] 45 B.2.8 Missing and Other Special Values R has a notion of a missing (not-available) value. It is very useful in data analysis, as we sometimes don’t have an information on an object’s feature. For instance, we might not know a patient’s age if he was admitted to the hospital unconscious. x &lt;- c(1, 2, NA, 4, 5) Operations on missing values generally result in missing values – that makes a lot sense. x + 11:15 ## [1] 12 14 NA 18 20 mean(x) ## [1] NA If we wish to compute a vector’s aggregate after all, we can get rid of the missing values by calling na.omit(): mean(na.omit(x)) # mean of non-missing values ## [1] 3 Note that in R, a dot has no special meaning. na.omit is as good of a function’s name or variable identifier as na_omit, naOmit, NAOMIT, naomit and NaOmit. Note that, however, R is a case-sensitive language – these are all different symbols. Read more in the Details section of ?make.names. Moreover, some arithmetic operations can result in infinities (\\(\\pm \\infty\\)): log(0) ## [1] -Inf 10^1000 # too large ## [1] Inf Also, sometimes we’ll get a not-a-number, NaN. This is not a missing value, but a “invalid” result. sqrt(-1) ## Warning in sqrt(-1): NaNs produced ## [1] NaN log(-1) ## Warning in log(-1): NaNs produced ## [1] NaN Inf-Inf ## [1] NaN "],
["logical-vectors.html", "B.3 Logical Vectors", " B.3 Logical Vectors B.3.1 Creating Logical Vectors In R there are 3 (!) logical values: TRUE, FALSE and, I don’t know, NA maybe? c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, NA, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE) ## [1] TRUE FALSE TRUE NA FALSE FALSE TRUE (x &lt;- rep(c(TRUE, FALSE, NA), 2)) ## [1] TRUE FALSE NA TRUE FALSE NA mode(x) ## [1] &quot;logical&quot; class(x) ## [1] &quot;logical&quot; length(x) ## [1] 6 By default, T is a synonym for TRUE and F for FALSE. This may be changed though so it’s better not to rely on these. B.3.2 Logical Operations Logical operators such as &amp; (and) and | (or) are performed in the same manner as arithmetic ones, i.e.: they are elementwise operations and recycling rule is applied if necessary. For example, TRUE &amp; TRUE ## [1] TRUE TRUE &amp; c(TRUE, FALSE) ## [1] TRUE FALSE c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE) | c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE) ## [1] TRUE FALSE TRUE TRUE The ! operator stands for logical elementwise negation: !c(TRUE, FALSE) ## [1] FALSE TRUE Generally, operations on NAs yield NA unless other solution makes sense. u &lt;- c(TRUE, FALSE, NA) v &lt;- c(TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, NA, NA, NA) u &amp; v # elementwise AND (conjunction) ## [1] TRUE FALSE NA FALSE FALSE FALSE NA FALSE NA u | v # elementwise OR (disjunction) ## [1] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE FALSE NA TRUE NA NA !u # elementwise NOT (negation) ## [1] FALSE TRUE NA B.3.3 Comparison Operations We can compare the corresponding elements of two numeric vectors and get a logical vector in result. Operators such as &lt; (less than), &lt;= (less than or equal), == (equal), != (not equal), &gt; (greater than) and &gt;= (greater than or equal) are again elementwise and use the recycling rule if necessary. 3 &lt; 1:5 # c(3, 3, 3, 3, 3) &lt; c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) ## [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE 1:2 == 1:4 # c(1,2,1,2) == c(1,2,3,4) ## [1] TRUE TRUE FALSE FALSE z &lt;- c(0, 3, -1, 1, 0.5) (z &gt;= 0) &amp; (z &lt;= 1) ## [1] TRUE FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE B.3.4 Aggregation Functions Also note the following operations on logical vectors: z &lt;- 1:10 all(z &gt;= 5) # are all values TRUE? ## [1] FALSE any(z &gt;= 5) # is there any value TRUE? ## [1] TRUE Moreover: sum(z &gt;= 5) # how many TRUE values are there? ## [1] 6 mean(z &gt;= 5) # what is the proportion of TRUE values? ## [1] 0.6 The behaviour of sum() and mean() is dictated by the fact that, when interpreted in numeric terms, TRUE is interpreted as numeric 1 and FALSE as 0. as.numeric(c(FALSE, TRUE)) ## [1] 0 1 Therefore in the example above we have: z &gt;= 5 ## [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE as.numeric(z &gt;= 5) ## [1] 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 sum(as.numeric(z &gt;= 5)) # the same as sum(z &gt;= 5) ## [1] 6 Yes, there are 6 values equal to TRUE (or 6 ones after conversion), the sum of zeros and ones gives the number of ones.

Their meaning is given by the levels() function: in the example above, the meaning of the codes 1, 2, 3 is, respectively, b, g, r. If we wished to generate a factor with a specific order of labels, we could call: factor(col, levels=c(&quot;red&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;)) ## [1] green green green red green red red red green blue ## Levels: red green blue We can also assign different labels upon creation of a factor: factor(col, levels=c(&quot;red&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;), labels=c(&quot;r&quot;, &quot;g&quot;, &quot;b&quot;)) ## [1] g g g r g r r r g b ## Levels: r g b Knowing how factors are represented is important when we deal with factors that are built around data that look like numeric. This is because their conversion to numeric gives the internal codes, not the actual values: (f &lt;- factor(c(1, 3, 0, 1, 4, 0, 0, 1, 4))) ## [1] 1 3 0 1 4 0 0 1 4 ## Levels: 0 1 3 4 as.numeric(f) # not necessarily what we want here ## [1] 2 3 1 2 4 1 1 2 4 as.numeric(as.character(f)) # much better ## [1] 1 3 0 1 4 0 0 1 4 Moreover, that idea is labour-saving in contexts such as plotting of data that are grouped into different classes. For instance, here is a scatter plot for the Sepal.Length and Petal.Width variables in the iris dataset (which is an object of type data.frame, see below). Flowers are of different Species, and we wish to indicate which point belongs to which class: plot(iris$Sepal.Length, # x iris$Petal.Width, # y col=as.numeric(iris$Species), # colours pch=as.numeric(iris$Species), # plotting characters las=1 # rotate Y axis labels ) The above was possible because the Species column is a factor object with: levels(iris$Species) ## [1] &quot;setosa&quot; &quot;versicolor&quot; &quot;virginica&quot; and the meaning of pch of 1, 2, 3, … is “circle”, “triangle”, “plus”, …, respectively. What’s more, there’s a default palette that maps consecutive integers to different colours: palette() ## [1] &quot;black&quot; &quot;red&quot; &quot;green3&quot; &quot;blue&quot; &quot;cyan&quot; &quot;magenta&quot; ## [7] &quot;yellow&quot; &quot;gray&quot; Hence, black circles mark irises from the 1st class, i.e., “setosa”.

["lists.html", "B.8 Lists", " B.8 Lists Numeric, logical and character vectors are atomic objects – each component is of the same type. Let’s take a look at what happens when we create an atomic vector out of objects of different types: c(&quot;nine&quot;, FALSE, 7, TRUE) ## [1] &quot;nine&quot; &quot;FALSE&quot; &quot;7&quot; &quot;TRUE&quot; c(FALSE, 7, TRUE, 7) ## [1] 0 7 1 7 In each case, we get an object of the most “general” type which is able to represent our data. On the other hand, R lists are generalised vectors. They can consist of arbitrary R objects, possibly of mixed types – also other lists. B.8.1 Creating Lists Most commonly, we create a generalised vector by calling the list() function. (l &lt;- list(1:5, letters, runif(3))) ## [[1]] ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 ## ## [[2]] ## [1] &quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;c&quot; &quot;d&quot; &quot;e&quot; &quot;f&quot; &quot;g&quot; &quot;h&quot; &quot;i&quot; &quot;j&quot; &quot;k&quot; &quot;l&quot; &quot;m&quot; &quot;n&quot; &quot;o&quot; ## [16] &quot;p&quot; &quot;q&quot; &quot;r&quot; &quot;s&quot; &quot;t&quot; &quot;u&quot; &quot;v&quot; &quot;w&quot; &quot;x&quot; &quot;y&quot; &quot;z&quot; ## ## [[3]] ## [1] 0.9568333 0.4533342 0.6775706 mode(l) ## [1] &quot;list&quot; class(l) ## [1] &quot;list&quot; length(l) ## [1] 3 There’s a more compact way to print a list on the console: str(l) ## List of 3 ## $ : int [1:5] 1 2 3 4 5 ## $ : chr [1:26] &quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;c&quot; &quot;d&quot; ... ## $ : num [1:3] 0.957 0.453 0.678 We can also convert an atomic vector to a list by calling: as.list(1:3) ## [[1]] ## [1] 1 ## ## [[2]] ## [1] 2 ## ## [[3]] ## [1] 3 B.8.2 Named Lists List, like other vectors, may be assigned a names attribute. names(l) &lt;- c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;) l ## $a ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 ## ## $b ## [1] &quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;c&quot; &quot;d&quot; &quot;e&quot; &quot;f&quot; &quot;g&quot; &quot;h&quot; &quot;i&quot; &quot;j&quot; &quot;k&quot; &quot;l&quot; &quot;m&quot; &quot;n&quot; &quot;o&quot; ## [16] &quot;p&quot; &quot;q&quot; &quot;r&quot; &quot;s&quot; &quot;t&quot; &quot;u&quot; &quot;v&quot; &quot;w&quot; &quot;x&quot; &quot;y&quot; &quot;z&quot; ## ## $c ## [1] 0.9568333 0.4533342 0.6775706 B.8.3 Subsetting and Extracting From Lists Applying a square brackets operator creates a sub-list, which is of type list as well. l[-1] ## $b ## [1] &quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;c&quot; &quot;d&quot; &quot;e&quot; &quot;f&quot; &quot;g&quot; &quot;h&quot; &quot;i&quot; &quot;j&quot; &quot;k&quot; &quot;l&quot; &quot;m&quot; &quot;n&quot; &quot;o&quot; ## [16] &quot;p&quot; &quot;q&quot; &quot;r&quot; &quot;s&quot; &quot;t&quot; &quot;u&quot; &quot;v&quot; &quot;w&quot; &quot;x&quot; &quot;y&quot; &quot;z&quot; ## ## $c ## [1] 0.9568333 0.4533342 0.6775706 l[c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;c&quot;)] ## $a ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 ## ## $c ## [1] 0.9568333 0.4533342 0.6775706 l[1] ## $a ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 Note in the 3rd case we deal with a list of length one, not a numeric vector. To extract (dig into) a particular (single) element, we use double square brackets: l[[1]] ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 l[[&quot;c&quot;]] ## [1] 0.9568333 0.4533342 0.6775706 The latter can equivalently be written as: l$c ## [1] 0.9568333 0.4533342 0.6775706 B.8.4 Common Operations Lists, because of their generality (they can store any kind of object), have few dedicated operations. In particular, it neither makes sense to add, multiply, … two lists together nor to aggregate them. However, if we wish to run some operation on each element, we can call list-apply: (k &lt;- list(x=runif(5), y=runif(6), z=runif(3))) # a named list ## $x ## [1] 0.57263340 0.10292468 0.89982497 0.24608773 0.04205953 ## ## $y ## [1] 0.3279207 0.9545036 0.8895393 0.6928034 0.6405068 0.9942698 ## ## $z ## [1] 0.6557058 0.7085305 0.5440660 lapply(k, mean) ## $x ## [1] 0.3727061 ## ## $y ## [1] 0.7499239 ## ## $z ## [1] 0.6361008 The above computes the mean of each of the three numeric vectors stored inside list k. unlist() tries (it might not always be possible) to unwind a list to a simpler, atomic form: unlist(lapply(k, mean)) ## x y z ## 0.3727061 0.7499239 0.6361008 Moreover, split(x, f) classifies elements in a vector x into subgroups defined by a factor (or an object coercible to) of the same length. x &lt;- c( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10) f &lt;- c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) split(x, f) ## $a ## [1] 1 3 4 8 9 ## ## $b ## [1] 2 6 7 10 ## ## $c ## [1] 5 This is very useful when combined with lapply() and unlist(). For instance, here are the mean sepal lengths for each of the three flower species in the famous iris dataset. unlist(lapply(split(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Species), mean)) ## setosa versicolor virginica ## 5.006 5.936 6.588 By the way, if we take a look at the documentation of ?lapply, we will note that that this function is defined as lapply(X, FUN, ...). Here ... denotes the optional arguments that will be passed to FUN. In other words, lapply(X, FUN, ...) returns a list Y of length length(X) such that Y[[i]] &lt;- FUN(X[[i]], ...) for each i. For example, mean() has an additional argument na.rm that aims to remove missing values from the input vector. Compare the following: t &lt;- list(1:10, c(1, 2, NA, 4, 5)) unlist(lapply(t, mean)) ## [1] 5.5 NA unlist(lapply(t, mean, na.rm=TRUE)) ## [1] 5.5 3.0 "],

The number of columns has been deduced automatically (otherwise, we would additionally have to pass ncol=3 to the function). Using mathematical notation, above we have defined \\(\\mathbf{A}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2\\times 3}\\): \\[ \\mathbf{A}= \\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc} a_{1,1} &amp; a_{1,2} &amp; a_{1,3} \\\\ a_{2,1} &amp; a_{2,2} &amp; a_{2,3} \\\\ \\end{array} \\right] = \\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\\\ 4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right] \\] We can fetch the size of the matrix by calling: dim(A) # number of rows, number of columns ## [1] 2 3 We can also “promote” a “flat” vector to a column vector, i.e., a matrix with one column by calling: as.matrix(1:3) ## [,1] ## [1,] 1 ## [2,] 2 ## [3,] 3 C.1.2 Stacking Vectors Other ways to create a matrix involve stacking a couple of vectors of equal lengths along each other: rbind(1:3, 4:6, 7:9) # row bind ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 2 3 ## [2,] 4 5 6 ## [3,] 7 8 9 cbind(1:3, 4:6, 7:9) # column bind ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 4 7 ## [2,] 2 5 8 ## [3,] 3 6 9 These functions also allow for adding new rows/columns to existing matrices: rbind(A, c(-1, -2, -3)) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 2 3 ## [2,] 4 5 6 ## [3,] -1 -2 -3 cbind(A, c(-1, -2)) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] ## [1,] 1 2 3 -1 ## [2,] 4 5 6 -2 C.1.3 Beyond Numeric Matrices Note that logical matrices are possible as well. For instance, knowing that comparison such as &lt; and == are performed elementwise also in the case of matrices, we can obtain: A &gt;= 3 ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] FALSE FALSE TRUE ## [2,] TRUE TRUE TRUE Moreover, although much more rarely used, we can define character matrices: matrix(LETTERS[1:12], ncol=6) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] ## [1,] &quot;A&quot; &quot;C&quot; &quot;E&quot; &quot;G&quot; &quot;I&quot; &quot;K&quot; ## [2,] &quot;B&quot; &quot;D&quot; &quot;F&quot; &quot;H&quot; &quot;J&quot; &quot;L&quot; C.1.4 Naming Rows and Columns Just like vectors could be equipped with names attribute: c(a=1, b=2, c=3) ## a b c ## 1 2 3 matrices can be assigned row and column labels in the form of a list of two character vectors: dimnames(A) &lt;- list( c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;), # row labels c(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot;) # column labels ) A ## x y z ## a 1 2 3 ## b 4 5 6 C.1.5 Other Methods The read.table() (and its special case, read.csv()), can be used to read a matrix from a text file. We will cover it in the next chapter, because technically it returns a data frame object (which we can convert to a matrix with a call to as.matrix()). outer() applies a given (vectorised) function on each pair of elements from two vectors, forming a two-dimensional “grid”. More precisely outer(x, y, f, ...) returns a matrix \\(\\mathbf{Z}\\) with length(x) rows and length(y) columns such that \\(z_{i,j}=f(x_i, y_j, ...)\\), where ... are optional further arguments to f. outer(c(1, 10, 100), 1:5, &quot;*&quot;) # apply the multiplication operator ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] ## [1,] 1 2 3 4 5 ## [2,] 10 20 30 40 50 ## [3,] 100 200 300 400 500 outer(c(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;), 1:8, paste, sep=&quot;-&quot;) # concatenate strings ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] ## [1,] &quot;A-1&quot; &quot;A-2&quot; &quot;A-3&quot; &quot;A-4&quot; &quot;A-5&quot; &quot;A-6&quot; &quot;A-7&quot; &quot;A-8&quot; ## [2,] &quot;B-1&quot; &quot;B-2&quot; &quot;B-3&quot; &quot;B-4&quot; &quot;B-5&quot; &quot;B-6&quot; &quot;B-7&quot; &quot;B-8&quot; simplify2array() is an extension of the unlist() function.

As an exercise, we recommend multiplying a few simple matrices of sizes \\(2\\times 2\\), \\(2\\times 3\\), \\(3\\times 2\\) etc. using pen and paper and checking the results in R. Also remember that, mathematically, squaring a matrix is done in terms of matrix multiplication, i.e., \\(\\mathbf{A}^2 = \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{A}\\). It can only be performed on square matrices, i.e., ones with the same number of rows and columns. This is again different than R’s elementwise A^2. Note that \\(\\mathbf{A}^T \\mathbf{A}\\) gives the matrix that consists of the dot products of all the pairs of columns in \\(\\mathbf{A}\\). crossprod(A) # same as t(A) %*% A ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] 10 14 ## [2,] 14 20 In one of the chapters on Regression, we note that the Pearson linear correlation coefficient can be beautifully expressed this way. C.2.5 Matrix-Vector Operations Mathematically, there is no generally agreed upon convention defining arithmetic operations between matrices and vectors. (*) The only exception is the matrix – vector multiplication in the case where an argument is a column or a row vector, i.e., in fact, a matrix. Hence, given \\(\\mathbf{A}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times p}\\) we may write \\(\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}\\) only if \\(\\mathbf{x}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{p\\times 1}\\) is a column vector. Similarly, \\(\\mathbf{y}\\mathbf{A}\\) makes only sense whenever \\(\\mathbf{y}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{1\\times n}\\) is a row vector. Please take notice of the fact that we consistently discriminate between different bold math fonts and letter cases: \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) is a matrix, \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) is a row or column vector (still a matrix, but a sequence-like one) and \\(\\boldsymbol{x}\\) is an ordinary vector (one-dimensional sequence). However, in R, we might sometimes wish to vectorise an arithmetic operation between a matrix and a vector in a row- or column-wise fashion. For example, if \\(\\mathbf{A}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times p}\\) is a matrix and \\(\\mathbf{m}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{1\\times p}\\) is a row vector, we might want to subtract \\(m_i\\) from each element in the \\(i\\)-th column. Here, the apply() function comes in handy: apply(A, 1, f) applies a given function \\(f\\) on each row of \\(\\mathbf{A}\\). apply(A, 2, f) applies a given function \\(f\\) on each column of \\(\\mathbf{A}\\). Usually, either \\(f\\) returns a single value (when we wish to aggregate all the elements in a row/column) or returns the same number of values (when we wish to transform a row/column). Example: to create a centred version of a given matrix, we need to subtract from each element the arithmetic mean of its column. (A &lt;- cbind(c(1, 2), c(2, 4), c(5, 8))) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 2 5 ## [2,] 2 4 8 (m &lt;- apply(A, 2, mean)) # same as colMeans(A) ## [1] 1.5 3.0 6.5 t(apply(A, 1, function(r) r-m)) # note the transpose here ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] -0.5 -1 -1.5 ## [2,] 0.5 1 1.5 The above is equivalent to: apply(A, 2, function(c) c-mean(c)) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] -0.5 -1 -1.5 ## [2,] 0.5 1 1.5 "],

Hence, to extract an element from a matrix, we will need two indices. Mathematically, given a matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\), \\(a_{i,j}\\) stands for the element in the \\(i\\)-th row and the \\(j\\)-th column. The same in R: A[1, 2] # 1st row, 2nd columns ## [1] 2 B[&quot;a&quot;, &quot;y&quot;] # using dimnames == B[1,2] ## [1] 2 C.3.2 Selecting Rows and Columns We will sometimes use the following notation to emphasise that a matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) consists of \\(n\\) rows or \\(p\\) columns: \\[ \\mathbf{A}=\\left[ \\begin{array}{c} \\mathbf{a}_{1,\\cdot} \\\\ \\mathbf{a}_{2,\\cdot} \\\\ \\vdots\\\\ \\mathbf{a}_{n,\\cdot} \\\\ \\end{array} \\right] = \\left[ \\begin{array}{cccc} \\mathbf{a}_{\\cdot,1} &amp; \\mathbf{a}_{\\cdot,2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\mathbf{a}_{\\cdot,p} \\\\ \\end{array} \\right]. \\] Here, \\(\\mathbf{a}_{i,\\cdot}\\) is a row vector of length \\(p\\), i.e., a \\((1\\times p)\\)-matrix: \\[ \\mathbf{a}_{i,\\cdot} = \\left[ \\begin{array}{cccc} a_{i,1} &amp; a_{i,2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; a_{i,p} \\\\ \\end{array} \\right]. \\] Moreover, \\(\\mathbf{a}_{\\cdot,j}\\) is a column vector of length \\(n\\), i.e., an \\((n\\times 1)\\)-matrix: \\[ \\mathbf{a}_{\\cdot,j} = \\left[ \\begin{array}{cccc} a_{1,j} &amp; a_{2,j} &amp; \\cdots &amp; a_{n,j} \\\\ \\end{array} \\right]^T=\\left[ \\begin{array}{c} {a}_{1,j} \\\\ {a}_{2,j} \\\\ \\vdots\\\\ {a}_{n,j} \\\\ \\end{array} \\right], \\] We can extract individual rows and columns from a matrix by using the following notation: A[1,] # 1st row ## [1] 1 2 3 4 A[,2] # 2nd column ## [1] 2 6 10 B[&quot;a&quot;,] # of course, B[1,] is still legal ## x y z w ## 1 2 3 4 B[,&quot;y&quot;] ## a b c ## 2 6 10 Note that by extracting a single row/column, we get an atomic (one-dimensional) vector. However, we can preserve the dimensionality of the output object by passing drop=FALSE: A[ 1, , drop=FALSE] # 1st row ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] ## [1,] 1 2 3 4 A[ , 2, drop=FALSE] # 2nd column ## [,1] ## [1,] 2 ## [2,] 6 ## [3,] 10 B[&quot;a&quot;, , drop=FALSE] ## x y z w ## a 1 2 3 4 B[ , &quot;y&quot;, drop=FALSE] ## y ## a 2 ## b 6 ## c 10 Now this is what we call proper row and column vectors! C.3.3 Selecting Submatrices To create a sub-block of a given matrix we pass two indexers, possibly of length greater than one: A[1:2, c(1, 2, 4)] # rows 1,2 columns 1,2,4 ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 2 4 ## [2,] 5 6 8 B[c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;), c(1, 2, 4)] ## x y w ## a 1 2 4 ## b 5 6 8 A[c(1, 3), 3] ## [1] 3 11 A[c(1, 3), 3, drop=FALSE] ## [,1] ## [1,] 3 ## [2,] 11 C.3.4 Selecting Based on Logical Vectors and Matrices We can also subset a matrix with a logical matrix of the same size. This always yields a (flat) vector in return. A[A&gt;8] ## [1] 9 10 11 12 Logical vectors can also be used as indexers: A[c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE),] # select 1st and 3rd row ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] ## [1,] 1 2 3 4 ## [2,] 9 10 11 12 A[,colMeans(A)&gt;6] # columns with means &gt; 6 ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] 3 4 ## [2,] 7 8 ## [3,] 11 12 C.3.5 Selecting Based on Two-Column Matrices Lastly, note that we can also index a matrix A with a 2-column matrix I, i.e., A[I]. This allows for an easy access to A[I[1,1], I[1,2]], A[I[2,1], I[2,2]], A[I[3,1], I[3,2]], … I &lt;- cbind(c(1, 3, 2, 1, 2), c(2, 3, 2, 1, 4) ) A[I] ## [1] 2 11 6 1 8 This is exactly A[1, 2], A[3, 3], A[2, 2], A[1, 1], A[2, 4].

["metaprogramming-and-formulas.html", "D.5 Metaprogramming and Formulas (*)", " D.5 Metaprogramming and Formulas (*) R (together with a few other programming languages such as Lisp and Scheme, that heavily inspired R’s semantics) allows its programmers to apply some metaprogramming techniques, that is, to write programs that manipulate unevaluated R expressions. For instance, take a close look at the following plot: z &lt;- seq(-2*pi, 2*pi, length.out=101) plot(z, sin(z), type=&#39;l&#39;, las=1) How did the plot() function know that we are plotting sin of z? It turns out that, at any time, we not only have access to the value of an object (such as the result of evaluating sin(z), which is a vector of 101 reals) but also to the expression that was passed as a function’s argument itself. test_meta &lt;- function(x) { cat(&quot;x equals to &quot;, x, &quot;\\n&quot;) # \\n == newline cat(&quot;x stemmed from &quot;, deparse(substitute(x)), &quot;\\n&quot;) } test_meta(2+7) ## x equals to 9 ## x stemmed from 2 + 7 This is very powerful and yet potentially very confusing to the users, because we can write functions that don’t compute the arguments provided in a way we expect them to (i.e., following the R language specification). Each function can constitute a new micro-verse, where with its own rules – we should always refer to the documentation. For instance, consider the subset() function: head(iris) ## Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species ## 1 5.1 3.5 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 2 4.9 3.0 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 3 4.7 3.2 1.3 0.2 setosa ## 4 4.6 3.1 1.5 0.2 setosa ## 5 5.0 3.6 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 6 5.4 3.9 1.7 0.4 setosa subset(iris, Sepal.Length&gt;7.5, select=-(Sepal.Width:Petal.Width)) ## Sepal.Length Species ## 106 7.6 virginica ## 118 7.7 virginica ## 119 7.7 virginica ## 123 7.7 virginica ## 132 7.9 virginica ## 136 7.7 virginica Neither Sepal.Length&gt;6 nor -(Sepal.Width:Petal.Width) make sense as standalone R expressions! However, according to the subset() function’s own rules, the former expression is considered as a row selector (here, Sepal.Length refers to a particular column within the iris data frame). The latter plays the role of a column filter (select everything but all the column between…). The data.table and dplyr functions rely on this language feature all the time, so we shouldn’t be surprised when we see them. There is one more interesting language feature that is possible thanks to metaprogramming. Formulas are special R objects that consist of two unevaluated R expressions separated by a tilde (~). For example: len ~ supp+dose ## len ~ supp + dose A formula on its own has no meaning. However, many R functions accept formulas as arguments and can interpret them in various different ways. For example, the lm() function that fits a linear regression model, uses formulas to specify the output and input variables: lm(Sepal.Length~Petal.Length+Sepal.Width, data=iris) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = Sepal.Length ~ Petal.Length + Sepal.Width, data = iris) ## ## Coefficients: ## (Intercept) Petal.Length Sepal.Width ## 2.2491 0.4719 0.5955 On the other hand, boxplot() allows for creating separate box-and-whisker plots for each subgroup given by a combination of factors. boxplot(len~supp+dose, data=ToothGrowth, las=1, horizontal=TRUE) The aggregate() function supports formulas too: aggregate(cbind(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width)~Species, data=iris, mean) ## Species Sepal.Length Sepal.Width ## 1 setosa 5.006 3.428 ## 2 versicolor 5.936 2.770 ## 3 virginica 6.588 2.974 We should therefore make sure that we know how every function interacts with a formula – information on that can be found in ?lm, ?boxplot, ?aggregate and so forth.
