## Aim and Scope

Machine learning has numerous exciting real-world applications,
including stock market prediction, speech recognition,
computer-aided medical diagnosis, content and product recommendation,
anomaly detection in security camera footages, game playing,
autonomous vehicle operation and many others.

In this book we will take a deep dive into some of the most fundamental
algorithms that stood the test of time and that still form
the basis for the state-of-the-art solutions of the modern-era AI,
which is principally (big) data-driven.
We will learn how to use the R language
for implementing various stages
of data processing and modelling activities.

We will provide solid underpinnings for further studies
related to statistical learning, machine learning
data science, data analytics and artificial intelligence.
We will appreciate the vital role of mathematics as a commonly accepted
language for formalising data-intense problems and communicating their solutions.
The book is aimed at a reader that is yet to be fluent with
university-level linear algebra, calculus and probability theory,
such as a 1st year undergrad.




## About Me


I'm currently a Senior Lecturer in Applied AI at Deakin University
in Melbourne, Australia
and an Associate Professor in Data Science at Warsaw University of Technology,
Poland, where I taught various courses related to
R and Python programming, algorithms,
data science and machine learning.
This book was also inspired by my teaching experience at
[Data Science Retreat](https://datascienceretreat.com) in Berlin, Germany.

I'm an author of several R and Python packages, including
[stringi](http://www.gagolewski.com/software/stringi/),
which is among the top 20 most often downloaded R extensions.
I'm an author of more than 70 publications, my research interests include
machine learning and optimisation algorithms, data aggregation and clustering,
statistical modelling and scientific computing.
