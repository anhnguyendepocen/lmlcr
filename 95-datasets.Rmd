# Datasets {#appendix:datasets}

<!-- (C) 2020 Marek Gagolewski, https://www.gagolewski.com -->



Below we briefly describe the most noteworthy
datasets considered in this book.
They are available for download at
https://github.com/gagolews/lmlcr/tree/master/datasets.
Many of them are real-world data, and need some proper cleaning,
outlier removal etc. Moreover, for some of them, the machine learning
models studied will not be of the highest quality. That's life.


"Good" datasets are actually hard to find!
Many books analyse datasets that are "too easy"; they give their readers
the false impression that anything can be modelled well with machine learning
algorithms. Most often, you will be dealing with datasets that are incapable
of telling any interesting story. Fear not, this is not personal,
you are not stupid if you cannot find any useful pattern in your data!
You might be forced
(by your thesis supervisor, manager, client,
you-the-utterly-ambitious-yourself that wants to prove your point, get
that paper published, show off your superb data science skills in front
of your workmates etc.) to squeeze something out of it anyway.
If but few tear drops are really there,
communicating this openly should be part of your work ethics.




Remark.

: The files with the `.csv.gz` extension are CSVs compressed with
`gzip` (a widespread, open source format).
R is able to decompress them on-the-fly when we use, e.g., `read.csv()`.




Compatibility note.

: We recommend that you use R version 4.0 or later. If this is not the case,
please issue `options(stringsAsFactors=FALSE)` at the beginning
of each R session or add the `stringsAsFactors=FALSE` argument
to each call to `read.csv()`, `data.frame()` etc.
Otherwise,




## Sustainable Society Indices


Van de Kerk and Manuel in [@ssi], by extending
the famous definition from the "Brundtland Report"
[@brundtland_report], proclaim that:

> *A sustainable society is a society that:*
>
> * *meets the needs of the present generation,*
> * *does not compromise the ability of future generations to meet their own needs,*
> * *in which each human being has the opportunity to develop itself in freedom,
>   within a well-balanced society and in harmony with its surroundings.*

In 2006 they have established the Sustainable Society Foundation,
headquartered in the Netherlands,
with the objective to develop the Sustainable Society Indices whose
aim is to aid in answering the question of "How sustainable is your country?".

The most recent, 2016, edition of SSI includes 21 indicators that are based
on publicly available data (UNESCO, FAO etc.).
Raw scores (such as CO2 emissions per capita, life expectancy at birth
or the ratio of income of the richest 10% to the poorest 10% citizens)
have been transformed onto the 0-10 scale by means of the formulas explained in detail
in http://www.ssfindex.com/ssi2016/wp-content/uploads/pdf/calculation-formulas-2016.pdf

The 21 fine-grained indicators can be aggregated (by means of the geometric mean)
into 7 categories, which in turn form 3 dimensions:


* Human Wellbeing

    a. Basic Needs
        1. Sufficient Food
        2. Sufficient to Drink
        3. Safe Sanitation

    b. Personal Development and Health

        4. Education
        5. Healthy Life
        6. Gender Equality

    c. Well-balanced Society

        7. Income Distribution
        8. Population Growth
        9. Good Governance

* Environmental Wellbeing

    d. Natural Resources

        10. Biodiversity
        11. Renewable Water Resources
        12. Consumption

    e. Climate and Energy

        13. Energy Use
        14. Energy Savings
        15. Greenhouse Gases
        16. Renewable Energy

* Economic Wellbeing

    f. Transition

        17. Organic Farming
        18. Genuine Savings

    g. Economy

        19. GDP
        20. Employment
        21. Public Debt

All the indices are explained in very detail in the whitepapers
and reports available at http://www.ssfindex.com/ssi/calculation-methodology/.

## Currency Exchange Rates

Statistical Data Warehouse of the European Central Bank System
publishes currency exchange rates (quoted against EUR)
that are updated once per working day.

The column names give the traditional ISO 4217 currency designators
(see Table below), for instance JPY stands for the Japanese (JP)
yen.

In each column like `YYY`, the quotation (EUR/YYY) is listed,
giving the price of the Euro (here: the base currency)
expressed in the  counter/quote currency YYY,
e.g., the value of 118.0 in JPY means that 1 euro = 118 yens.

From this dataset we derive two following ones.

`currency_exchange_single`.

: The EUR/AUD rates only, from the least to the most recent:


    ```{r datasets_rates2,eval=FALSE}
    write.table(rev(currency_exchange$AUD),
        "datasets/currency_exchange_single.csv",
        col.names=FALSE, row.names=FALSE, quote=FALSE)
    ```


`currency_exchange_diff`.

:   Relative daily changes
    in the EUR/AUD rates (we use it for building example
    exchange rates prediction algorithms):


    ```{r datasets_rates3}
    n <- nrow(currency_exchange)
    pred <- currency_exchange[n:1, c("Day", "AUD")] # from oldest to newest
    row.names(pred) <- NULL # reset the row.names attribute
    pred$Change <- NA
    pred$Change[2:n] <- diff(pred$AUD) # iterative difference:
        # pred$Change[2] == pred$AUD[2]-pred$AUD[1], ...,
        # pred$Change[n] == pred$AUD[n]-pred$AUD[n-1]
    pred$Dir <- as.character(cut(pred$Change, c(-Inf, 0, Inf),
        c("dec", "inc"))) # inc if Change is positive, dec otherwise
    for (k in 1:10) {
        name <- paste0("Lag", k)
        pred[[name]] <- NA
        pred[[name]][(k+1):n] <- pred$Change[1:(n-k)]
    }
    tail(pred)
    ```


    Note that `pred$Change[i]` gives by how much the exchange rate
    changed as compared to the previous day, i.e., it is equal to
    `pred$AUD[i]-pred$AUD[i-1]`. `Lag1` is the change from the preceding
    working day, `Lag2` is the one from 2 working days ago, etc.


    ```{r datasets_rates4,eval=FALSE}
    write.csv(pred, "datasets/currency_exchange_diff.csv.gz",
       row.names=FALSE)
    ```

`wine_train`, `wine_test`.

:   In the first chapters we want to set up a working classifier as
    fast as possible, without going into details on why and how to perform
    a train-test split etc. Therefore, let's prepare a tailored subset
    of the wine quality database.

    First, we select 500 white wines at random:

    ```{r wine_train_test_split1}
    set.seed(1234) # reproducibility matters
    wine_subset <- wine_quality[wine_quality$color=="white",]
    wine_subset <- wine_subset[sample(nrow(wine_subset), 500),]
    ```

    Next we create a new column that tells us whether
    a given wine is bad (class 1, quality is not greater than 5)
    or not-bad:

    ```{r wine_train_test_split2}
    wine_subset$bad <- as.numeric(wine_subset$response <= 5)
    ```

    For simplicity, we are  only interested in 5 following physicochemical
    features:

    ```{r wine_train_test_split3}
    wine_subset <- wine_subset[, c(
        "alcohol", "volatile.acidity", "chlorides",
        "free.sulfur.dioxide", "total.sulfur.dioxide", "bad"
    )]
    ```

    Then we perform a 60/40% split. The rows in the data frame
    are already randomised, therefore the first 300 can constitute
    the training sample and the remaining 200  can define the test sample.

    ```{r wine_train_test_split4,eval=FALSE}
    write.csv(wine_subset[1:300, ],
        "datasets/wine_train.csv", row.names=FALSE)
    write.csv(wine_subset[-(1:300), ],
        "datasets/wine_test.csv", row.names=FALSE)
    ```

## EdStats (Country-Level Education Statistics)

The file `edstats_2019.csv.gz` provides us with many
country-level Education Statistics extracted from the World Bank's Databank.
Databank aggregates information from such sources as
the UNESCO Institute for Statistics,
OECD Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA)
etc. The official description reads:

> "The World Bank EdStats Query holds around 2,500 internationally comparable
education indicators for access, progression, completion, literacy, teachers,
population, and expenditures. The indicators cover the education cycle from
pre-primary to tertiary education. The query also holds learning outcome data
from international learning assessments (PISA, TIMSS, etc.), equity data
from household surveys, and projection data to 2050."

```{r edstats_wide_1}
edstats_2019 <- read.csv("datasets/edstats_2019.csv.gz",
    comment.char="#")
head(edstats_2019)
```

This data frame is in a "long" format, where each indicator
for each country is given in its own row. Note that we extracted
the indicators reported between 2010 and 2019 and that some of them
are not surveyed/updated every year.




`edstats_2019_wide`.

: Let's convert this dataset to the "wide" format (one row per country,
each indicator in its own column) based on the most recent indicators.

First we need a function that returns the last non-missing value in a
given numeric vector.
To recall, `na.omit()`, removes all missing values and `tail()` can be
used to access the last observation easily. Unfortunately, if the vector
is consists of missing values only, the removal of `NA`s leads
to an empty sequence. However, the trick we can use is that
by extracting the first element from an empty vector by using
`[...]`, we get a `NA`.


```{r edstats_wide_2}
last_non_na <- function(x) tail(na.omit(x), 1)[1]
last_non_na(c(1, 2, NA, 3,NA,NA)) # example 1
last_non_na(c(NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA)) # example 2
```

Let's extract the most recent indicator from each row in `edstats_2019`.

```{r edstats_wide_3}
values <- apply(edstats_2019[-(1:4)], 1, last_non_na)
head(values)
```

Now, we shall create a data frame with 3 columns:
name of the country, indicator code, indicator value.
Let's order it with respect to the first two columns.

```{r edstats_wide_4}
edstats_2019 <- edstats_2019[c("CountryName", "Code")]
# add a new column at the righthand end:
edstats_2019["Value"] <- values
edstats_2019 <- edstats_2019[
    order(edstats_2019$CountryName, edstats_2019$Code), ]
head(edstats_2019)
```


To convert the data frame to a "wide" format, many readers would choose
the `pivot_wider()` function from the `tidyr` package
(amongst others).


```{r edstats_wide_5}
library("tidyr")
edstats <- as.data.frame(
    pivot_wider(edstats_2019, names_from="Code", values_from="Value")
)
edstats[1, 1:7]
```


Side note (\*).

:   The above solution is of course perfectly fine
    and we can now live long and prosper.
    Nevertheless, we are here to learn new skills, so let's note
    that it has the drawback that it required
    us to search for the answer on the internet (and go through many "answers"
    that actually don't work). If we are not converting between the long and the
    wide formats on a daily basis, this might not be worth the hassle
    (moreover, there's no guarantee that this function will work the same
    way in the future, that the package we relied on will provide the same API etc.).

    Instead, by relaying on a bit deeper knowledge of R programming
    (which we already have gained, see Appendices \@ref(appendix:rvector),
     \@ref(appendix:rmatrix) and  \@ref(appendix:rdf)),
    we could implement the relevant procedure manually. The downside is that
    this requires us to get out of our comfort zone and... think.

    First, let's generate the list of all countries and indicators:

    ```{r edstats_wide_6}
    countries  <- unique(edstats_2019$CountryName)
    head(countries)
    indicators <- unique(edstats_2019$Code)
    head(indicators)
    ```

    Second, note that `edstats_2019` gives all the possible combinations (pairs)
    of the indexes and countries:

    ```{r edstats_wide_7}
    nrow(edstats_2019) # number of rows in edstats_2019
    length(countries)*length(indicators) # number of pairs
    ```

    Looking at the numbers in the `Value` column of `edstats_2019`,
    this will exactly provide us with our desired "wide" data matrix,
    if we read it in a rowwise manner. Hence, we can use
    `matrix(..., byrow=TRUE)` to generate it:

    ```{r edstats_wide_8}
    # edstats_2019 is already sorted w.r.t. CountryName and Code
    edstats2 <- cbind(
        CountryName=countries, # first column
        as.data.frame(
            matrix(edstats_2019$Value,
                byrow=TRUE,
                ncol=length(indicators),
                dimnames=list(NULL, indicators)
        )))
    identical(edstats, edstats2)
    ```



Now we can export `edstats` to a CSV file.

```{r edstats_wide_9,eval=FALSE}
write.csv(edstats, "datasets/edstats_2019_wide.csv", row.names=FALSE)
```

We didn't export the row names, because they're useless in our case.

based on their description included in
`Series` column of the accompanying `edstats_meta.csv` file.

## Clustering Benchmarks

In the Exercises section of
Chapter XXX<!-- TODO --> we study a few clustering benchmark datasets.
They are two-dimensional, so that it's possible to visualise
the obtained results and quality of the obtained clusterings.

The `wut_isolation`, `wut_mk2` and `wut_z3` datasets
were created by the author's fantastic students at Warsaw University of Technology
and are part of the *Benchmark Suite for Clustering Algorithms - Version 1* .

the famous Fisher's Iris flower dataset,
see `?iris` in R
and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set.

The famous `Boston` dataset from the `MASS` package
records the historical (in the 1970s) median house value
(`medv` column, in 1,000s USD) for 506 suburbs around
Boston, MA, USA.

You can access the dataset by calling:

```{r Boston_load1,message=FALSE}
# call install.packages("MASS") first (only once)
library("MASS")
head(Boston, 3)
```

Read the description of each of the 14 columns in the dataset's manual,
see `?Boston`.





Here is a famous illustrative example proposed by
the statistician Francis Anscombe in the early 1970s.

```{r anscombe}
print(anscombe) # `anscombe` is a built-in object
```

What we see above is a single data frame
that encodes four separate datasets:
`anscombe$x1` and `anscombe$y1` define the first pair of variables,
`anscombe$x2` and `anscombe$y2` define the second pair and so forth.
