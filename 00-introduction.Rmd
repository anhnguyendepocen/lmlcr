#### Aim and Scope  {.unnumbered}

Machine learning has numerous exciting real-world applications,
including game playing, stock market prediction, speech recognition,
computer-aided medical diagnosis, content and product recommendation,
anomaly detection in security camera footages,
autonomous vehicle operation, amongst many others.

In this book we will take a deep dive into some of the most fundamental
algorithms that stood the test of time and that still form
the basis for the state-of-the-art solutions of the modern-era AI,
which is principally (big) data-driven.
We will learn how to use the R language [@rpoject]
for implementing various stages
of data processing and modelling activities.
For a more in-depth treatment of R, see,
for instance, [@rprogdatascience; @r4ds].

We will provide solid underpinnings for further studies
related to statistical learning, machine learning
data science, data analytics and artificial intelligence,
including [@islr; @esl; @bishop].
We will appreciate the vital role of mathematics as a commonly accepted
language for formalising data-intense problems and communicating their solutions.
The book is aimed at a reader that is yet to be fluent with
university-level linear algebra, calculus and probability theory,
such as a 1st year undergrad.

During the writing of this book, I've been mostly listening to the music
featuring John Coltrane, Krzysztof Komeda,
Henry Threadgill, Albert Ayler, Paco de Lucia and Tomatito.
