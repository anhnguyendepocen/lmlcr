#### Aims and Scope  {.unnumbered}


Machine learning has numerous exciting real-world applications,
including stock market prediction, speech recognition,
computer-aided medical diagnosis, content and product recommendation,
anomaly detection in security camera footages, game playing,
autonomous vehicle operation and many others.

In this book we will take a unpretentious glance at the most fundamental
algorithms which stood the test of time and which still form
the basis for the state-of-the-art solutions of the modern-era AI,
which is principally (big) data-driven.
We will learn how to use the R language [@rpoject]
for implementing various stages
of data processing and modelling activities.
For a more in-depth treatment of R, refer to this book's Appendices
and, for instance, [@Rintro; @rprogdatascience; @r4ds].

We will provide solid underpinnings for further studies
related to statistical learning, machine learning
data science, data analytics and artificial intelligence,
including [@islr; @esl; @bishop].
We will appreciate the vital role of mathematics as a commonly accepted
language for formalising data-intense problems and communicating their solutions.
The book is aimed at readers who are yet to be fluent with
university-level linear algebra, calculus and probability theory,
such as 1st year undergrads or those who have forgotten
all the maths they have learned and need a gentle, non-invasive,
yet rigorous enough, introduction to the topic.
For a nice, machine learning-focused introduction to mathematics alone,
see, e.g., [@mml].


<!-- TODO: This book is structured as follows. -->

<!-- TODO: This book is non-standard in the way that:
* it doesn't assume that the reader is familiar with the concept
of probability, unlike many other books on statistical learning (especially with the
use of the R language)
* it only assumes high school-level mathematics; basic linear algebra concepts
(of which matrix multiplication is the most difficult one) are explained;
there is some reference to function differentiation, however the material is optional
and marked with an asterisk;
I am aware of the fact that some readers might struggle with the $\sum$ notation
for summation, but this is explained in the book;
I hope this book is a nice appreciation of the higher maths courses such as
linear algebra, calculus, discrete maths as well as probability and statistics
* then, once the math groundwork is laid, the reader will be ready for other
excellent books, like ESL, Bishop etc.
* it takes an algorithmic approach to the description of machine learning models
(yet, the models are not treated as black-boxes; we don't just apply functions
from different packages, but try to implement them on our own)
* it doesn't  assume any prior exposure to programming languages;
essential R basics are introduced in a rigorous manner and are self-contained;
it's not going to be easy, but all the building blocks (together with exercises)
are provided
* it demystifies and deconstructs the "coolness" of AI -- putting
all the hype aside, super-duper-tensor-GPU-cloud-self-driving-1-billion-revenue-
you-must-buy-our-products, it demonstrates that the basic concepts behind most methods
have been known for decades (basically, our computers are now much faster
and we have much more data, that's it); you don't need to be excited
about each new product, new toolbox, new algorithms (and don't FOMO!);
stay calm, it's just an old dog that learned new tricks.

#### About Me  {.unnumbered}


I'm currently a Senior Lecturer in Applied AI at Deakin University
in Melbourne, Australia
and an Associate Professor in Data Science at Warsaw University of Technology,
Poland, where I teach various courses related to
R and Python programming, algorithms,
data science and machine learning.
This book was also influenced by my teaching experience at
[Data Science Retreat](https://datascienceretreat.com) in Berlin, Germany.

I'm an author of several R and Python packages, including
[stringi](http://www.gagolewski.com/software/stringi/),
which is among the top 20 most often downloaded R extensions.
I'm an author of more than 70 publications, my research interests include
machine learning and optimisation algorithms, data aggregation and clustering,
statistical modelling and scientific computing.



#### Acknowledgements  {.unnumbered}

This book has been prepared with pandoc, Markdown and GitBook.
R code chunks have been processed with knitr.
A little help of bookdown, good ol' Makefiles and shell scripts
did the trick.


```{r,echo=FALSE}
library("knitr")
library("bookdown")
library("stringi")
fs <- list.files("..", "\\.Rmd$", full=TRUE)
pkgs <- stri_unique(stri_sort(unlist(lapply(fs, function(f)
    na.omit(stri_match_first_regex(
        readLines(f), "^library\\(['\"]?(.*?)['\"]?\\)")[,2])))))
```

The following R packages are used or referred to in the text:
`r stri_flatten(pkgs, collapse=", ")`.

During the writing of this book, I've been mostly listening to the music
featuring John Coltrane, Krzysztof Komeda,
Henry Threadgill, Albert Ayler, Paco de Lucia and Tomatito.
